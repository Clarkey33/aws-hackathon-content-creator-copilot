The year is 1998. Manchester United, the mightiest club in all of England, are on the verge of an unprecedented Treble - the Premier League title, the FA Cup, and the elusive Champions League trophy. 

But their path to glory is blocked by a seemingly insurmountable obstacle: the ruthless Juventus, the reigning champions of Europe. And leading the charge for the Italians is a young, hungry striker from the tiny Caribbean island of Trinidad and Tobago - a man who was never supposed to reach these dizzying heights.

This is the story of how Dwight Yorke, against all odds, silenced his doubters and became Manchester United's unlikely savior in their most historic season.
