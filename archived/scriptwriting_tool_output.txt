In 1998, Manchester United made a decision that left football pundits scratching their heads. They spent a whopping £12.6 million on a striker from Aston Villa. Not just any striker – but one who began his career being told he wasn't good enough to make it in England.

This is the story of Dwight Yorke, the man who proved that sometimes, the most unlikely heroes write the most unforgettable stories.

[TITLE CARD: Act I - The Rise]

It all began in 1989, on a pre-season tour of the West Indies. Aston Villa's manager, Graham Taylor, spotted a raw talent playing on the beaches of Trinidad and Tobago. That talent was Dwight Yorke.

But Yorke's journey was far from smooth. In his early days at Villa, he struggled. His finishing was erratic, his positioning questioned. The Premier League, with its pace and physicality, seemed a world away from the laid-back football of the Caribbean.

But Yorke had something that couldn't be taught – an infectious smile and an unbreakable spirit. He worked tirelessly, transforming himself from a inconsistent winger to a lethal striker.
