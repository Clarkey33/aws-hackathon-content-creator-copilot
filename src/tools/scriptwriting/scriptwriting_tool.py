How did a striker from tiny Trinidad and Tobago become Manchester United's unlikely savior in their most historic season?
"""

Dwight Yorke, from Trinidad and Tobago, joined Aston Villa in 1989 after being discovered on a pre-season tour. 
Despite early struggles with his finishing, he became a key player. 
He moved to Manchester United in 1998 for Â£12.6 million, a controversial transfer. 
At Man Utd, he formed a legendary partnership with Andy Cole, winning the Treble (Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League) in his very first season. 
Many doubted if a player from a small nation could lead the line for the biggest club in the world, but he scored 29 goals that season, finishing as the Premier League's top scorer.
