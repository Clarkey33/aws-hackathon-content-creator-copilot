Dwight Yorke, from Trinidad and Tobago, joined Aston Villa in 1989 after being discovered on a pre-season tour. 
Despite early struggles with his finishing, he became a key player. 
He moved to Manchester United in 1998 for Â£12.6 million, a controversial transfer. 
At Man Utd, he formed a legendary partnership with Andy Cole, winning the Treble (Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League) in his very first season. 
Many doubted if a player from a small nation could lead the line for the biggest club in the world, but he scored 29 goals that season, finishing as the Premier League's top scorer.
