Yorke spent nine years at Villa Park and despite occasional problems with injuries and inconsistency, he averaged close to a goal ever three games (73 in 231 league appearances) and tasted victory in the 1996 League Cup final, scoring in a 3-0 win against Leeds United at Wembley.\n  \n  \nYorke’s silky touches and strike rate at Villa Park sparked the interest of Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson, who took the forward to Old Trafford in 1998 for a fee of £12.6 million. In his first three seasons at United, he formed with Andy Cole one of English football’s most prolific attacking duos in recent memory and played a crucial role as United won three consecutive league titles – not to mention the 1999 Champions League and FA Cup as part of a historic treble.\n  \n  \nIn all, Yorke scored 47 goals in 96 league appearances for Manchester United, a remarkable return, but after leaving Old Trafford for Blackburn in 2001, the goals appeared to dry up for the T&T international. His time in England ended with a short, unhappy spell at Birmingham City in the 2004/05 season and the striker with the famous toothy grin then sought a fresh start in Australia at Sydney FC. He was rewarded with silverware as he captained the Sydneysiders to the inaugural A-League Grand Final in March this year.\n  \n  \nAlthough already revered in his beloved Trinidad and Tobago, Yorke’s role in captaining the national team to their first finals in Germany in 2006 has made the man akin to a demigod in the Caribbean. A member of the team that so famously lost out on a spot at Italia 90 on the last day of qualifying, Yorke was inspirational in the Soca Warriors’ path to Germany.\n  \n  \nDescribed as a “special player” by coach Leo Beenhakker, Yorke’s roaming role just behind the front line allows all of his experience and tactical knowledge to shine through. He certainly looked in fine fettle when scoring both goals as T&T won their first match of this FIFA World Cup year against Iceland on 28 February.\n  \n  \nDespite his veteran status, Yorke retains a touch of class and, for all his achievements, the opportunity to play in his first FIFA World Cup finals has undoubtedly got him dreaming again.  \n**(FIFA WC 2006 profile)**\n\n  \n  \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Honors for Dwight |\n| * Trinidad & Tobago\'s Sports Hall of Fame in 2011 * English Championship winner\'s medal with Sunderland in 2006/2007 * Trinidad & Tobago Footballer of the Year in 2006 * Named as a Sports Ambassador of Trinidad & Tobago in 2006 * Trinidad & Tobago Chaconia Medal Gold (World Cup Squad) in 2006 * Australian A-League winner\'s medal with Sydney FC in 2005/2006 * Sydney FC\'s Forward of the Year in 2005/2006 * Tobago House of Assembly Chief Secretary\'s Award in 2005 * Trinidad & Tobago Footballer of the Year in 2005 * Top Goalscorer for Blackburn Rovers in 2002/2003 * English Premier League winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 2000/2001 * First non-English player to score 100 goals (in a 3-0 win at Derby County) in the Premiership in 2000/2001 * English Premier League Player of the Month (for March) with Manchester United in 2000 * English Premier League winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1999/2000 * Top Goalscorer for Manchester United in 1999/2000 * Intercontinental Cup winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1999 * 10th place in FIFA\'s World Player of the Year ranking in 1999 * English Premier League Player of the Month (for January) with Manchester United in 1999 * Trinidad & Tobago Chaconia Medal Gold (for Sport) in 1999 * English FA Cup winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1998/1999 * Joint Top Goalscorer in the UEFA Champions League with 8 goals in 1998/1999 * Named to the English Professional Football Association’s Team of the Year in 1998/1999 * Runner-up PFA Player of the Year in 1998/1999 * English Premier League Golden Boot Award (18 goals) in 1998/1999 * Carling Player of the Year in 1998/1999 * UEFA Champions League winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1998/1999 * English Premier League winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1998/1999 * Trinidad & Tobago Olympic Committee Sports Personality of the Year in 1998 * Top Goalscorer for Aston Villa in 1996/1997 * Aston Villa\'s Player of the Year in 1996/1997 * English FA Premiership Player of the Month (for February) with Aston Villa in 1996 * Aston Villa\'s Player of the Year in 1995/1996 * League Cup winner\'s medal with Aston Villa in 1995/1996 * Top Goalscorer for Aston Villa in 1995/1996 * Top Goalscorer for Aston Villa in 1994/1995 * Trinidad & Tobago Humming Bird Medal Silver (for Sport) in 1993 * Trinidad & Tobago Chaconia Medal Silver (World Cup Squad) in 1989 |\n\n  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related Articles | |\n| [Defend Home Fort: Yorke urges team to win T&T matches to qualify](/senior-team-news/26273-defend-home-fort-yorke-urges-team-to-win-t-t-matches-to-qualify.html) | Aug 22nd, 2025 |\n| [Caution: Don’t count World Cup chickens yet](/senior-team-news/26264-caution-don-t-count-world-cup-chickens-yet.html) | Aug 16th, 2025 |\n| [Dante Sealy soars in June...A new star rises in Trinidad and Tobago football](/senior-team-news/26212-dante-sealy-soars-in-june-a-new-star-rises-in-trinidad-and-tobago-football.html) | Jul 6th, 2025 |\n| [Sancho gives Soca Warriors \'puncher\'s chance\' for final World Cup qualifying round](/senior-team-news/26207-sancho-gives-soca-warriors-puncher-s-chance-for-final-world-cup-qualifying-round.html) | Jun 28th, 2025 |\n| [Yorke says T&T can compete—but can Warriors get to 2026 World Cup?](/senior-team-news/26203-yorke-says-t-t-can-compete-but-can-warriors-get-to-2026-world-cup.html) | Jun 26th, 2025 |\n| [Gold Cup gains](/senior-team-news/26200-gold-cup-gains.html) | Jun 24th, 2025 |\n| [No luck in Vegas: Trinidad and Tobago ousted after 1-1 draw with Saudi Arabia](/senior-team-news/26197-no-luck-in-vegas-trinidad-and-tobago-ousted-after-1-1-draw-with-saudi-arabia.html) | Jun 24th, 2025 |\n| [TTFA boss: No one broke camp, players fully committed](/senior-team-news/26195-ttfa-boss-no-one-broke-camp-players-fully-committed.html) | Jun 23rd, 2025 |\n| [All or nothing: Trinidad and Tobago battle Saudi Arabia for Gold Cup quarters spot](/senior-team-news/26194-all-or-nothing-trinidad-and-tobago-battle-saudi-arabia-for-gold-cup-quarters-spot.html) | Jun 22nd, 2025 |\n| [Yorke on draw with ten-man Haiti: We were afraid to make mistakes](/senior-team-news/26191-yorke-on-draw-with-ten-man-haiti-we-were-afraid-to-make-mistakes.html) | Jun 21st, 2025 |\n| [Yorke targets aggressive Haitians;

They were eliminated in the group stage without scoring a goal, in what was their first and only participation – for now.\n\nAlmost 20 years on, the 53-year-old is back leading the Soca Warriors, this team as head coach, but with the same motivation: bring the islands to the World Cup.\n\n“Football is a sport that really unites our country, we know how important it is,” Yorke tells Olympics.com at a training session in London during the 2025 Unity Cup. “We have a really good opportunity to try and qualify for the World Cup, although we still have some unfinished business to do.\n\n“I'm quietly confident that we can get it done and really give [ourselves] a good foundation and platform to try to qualify. I'm not going to get ahead of myself. There's still a lot of work to be done.”\n\nTrinidad and Tobago have returned to the top 100 in the FIFA men’s world rankings under Yorke – can he now steer them towards a first World Cup finals in two decades?\n\n* [FIFA World Cup 2026: These teams have qualified for the tournament - full list](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/football-qualified-teams-men-fifa-world-cup-2026)\n* [CONCACAF Gold Cup 2025: Full schedule, all results and standings - complete list](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/concacaf-gold-cup-2025-soccer-full-schedule-all-results-scorers-standings-complete-list)\n\n[Love football? ⚽ Relive the best football moments from Paris 2024 🏅](https://www.olympics.com/en/sign-in?entry_point_type=instory_campaign&entry_point_tag=football&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.olympics.com%2Fen%2Folympic-games%2Fparis-2024%2Fvideos)\n\n> [View this post on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKnN1ptuTUl/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n>\n> [A post shared by Dwight Yorke (@officialdwightyorke19)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKnN1ptuTUl/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n\n## Dwight Yorke, learning from the great Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nGiven that Yorke has been managed and mentored by some of the game’s finest managers, it is far from unexpected that he is now pursuing the same path.\n\nThe striker was signed by English giants Manchester United in 1998 by none other than Sir Alex Ferguson, the most successful manager in Premier League history with 13 titles.\n\nYorke came into a successful setup which brought even more silverware: in his first season alone, he won the treble (Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League) and went on to seize three consecutive league titles with the Red Devils.\n\nThe Trinidadian and Tobagonian was undoubtedly influenced by Sir Alex, not just on the pitch but off it and towards the dugout.\n\n“The mindset that I've taken from the gaffer is how to win football matches,” Yorke states of the former United manager, “and he's a serial winner himself, everybody knows that.”\n\nAfter retiring in 2009, Yorke needed time and patience upon entering the managerial sphere. With much persistence and patience, he landed his first job in Australia with Macarthur FC, leading them to their first major honour in the 2022 Australia Cup.\n\n“It took me a while,” Yorke admits of the adjustment from playing to coaching. “I've been focusing on managing for quite some time now. I've obviously had some experience in the past as well. We have made some really good progress in the months since I've taken over the job.”\n\nThe former national team captain arrived at the helm of the twin islands last November, having previously served as assistant coach for a brief spell following retirement.\n\nPicture by Ben Radford /Allsport\n\nSir Alex Ferguson (left) managed Dwight Yorke (centre) at Manchester United.\n\nHe continues, “The most important thing is the enjoyment of the game, and I think that's what has gone out of the game. We always know that we produce a bunch of talented players. It's just to have some self-belief in themselves and a better structure.\n\n“Having the players buy into my philosophy and understanding what it takes to be competitive, we are making progress, so that's a real positive despite the results.”\n\n## Yorke inspires Trinidad and Tobago: ‘Football is a vehicle to mobilise the country’\n\nWith a population of 1.3 million people, the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago have a special affinity for sport. They have won 19 medals at the Olympic Games, even venturing into the Winter Games as they prepare for [Milano Cortina 2026](https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/milano-cortina-2026).\n\nWhen it comes to football, it is the game that unites the nation with those around the world. That is not lost on Yorke, who knows what a World Cup would mean to his homeland.\n\nThe head coach explains, “We know what is required - the players understand that - and it takes a lot of sacrifice and determination to get there. We are a twin island, we are unique in itself. It would probably be my greatest achievement if we were to get to the World Cup again. The fact that it just brings our people closer together.\n\nPicture by Warren Little/Getty Images\n\nBRENTFORD, ENGLAND - MAY 27: Dwight Yorke, Manager of Trinidad & Tobago looks on during the Unity Cup between Jamacia and Trinidad & Tobago at Gtech Community Stadium on May 27, 2025 in Brentford, England. (Photo by Warren Little/Getty Images)\n\n“We had some turbulent times in the past, and I think football is a good vehicle to mobilise the country again. Football has played a crucial part in our society and our lives. It gives not just me, but the players, the people of Trinidad and Tobago, an enormous boost if we were to qualify for the World Cup.”\n\nIt is a little under a year until the FIFA World Cup, which takes place in the USA, Mexico and Canada from 11 June – 19 July 2026.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago are into the third and final CONCACAF qualifying round, where they enter a group of four teams. Should they top that group, they will return to the world stage after 20 years away.\n\nFirst, the focus is on the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup and a group lineup to relish. The Soca Warriors begin their campaign against hosts USA on 15 June, as Yorke goes toe-to-toe with former Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino.\n\n“There's lots of work to done, but hopefully we'll be able to get the job done,” Yorke concludes. “It's not going to be relatively straightforward as some people may think it is.”\n\n## ARE YOU HAPPY TO ACCEPT COOKIES?\n\nTo improve and personalise your experience, and help grow the Olympic Movement, the IOC, the Organising Committees for the Olympic and Paralympic Games and our partners use cookies.

Throughout his club career, he played for [Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. "Aston Villa F.C."), [Manchester United](/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C. "Manchester United F.C."), [Blackburn Rovers](/wiki/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C. "Blackburn Rovers F.C."), [Birmingham City](/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C. "Birmingham City F.C."), [Sydney FC](/wiki/Sydney_FC "Sydney FC") and [Sunderland](/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C. "Sunderland A.F.C."), mainly as a [forward](/wiki/Forward_(association_football) "Forward (association football)"), between 1998 and 2009. Yorke formed a prolific strike partnership with [Andy Cole](/wiki/Andy_Cole "Andy Cole") at Manchester United, where he won numerous honours including several [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League "Premier League") titles and the Treble of the Premier League, [FA Cup](/wiki/FA_Cup "FA Cup") and [UEFA Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League "UEFA Champions League") in [1999](/wiki/1998%E2%80%9399_Manchester_United_F.C._season "1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season"). Yorke scored 123 goals in the Premier League, a record for a non-[European](/wiki/Europe "Europe") which was not broken until [Sergio Agüero](/wiki/Sergio_Ag%C3%BCero "Sergio Agüero") in 2017.[[3]](#cite_note-3)\n\nAt international level, Yorke represented [Trinidad and Tobago](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_national_football_team "Trinidad and Tobago national football team") on 74 occasions between 1989 and 2009, scoring 19 goals. He helped his nation reach the semi-finals of the [2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup](/wiki/2000_CONCACAF_Gold_Cup "2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup"), and later qualify for the [FIFA World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup") for the first time in its history, representing his country in the [2006 tournament](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup "2006 FIFA World Cup"). After retiring from playing in 2009, Yorke became assistant manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team, a position he held until the completion of the [qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification "2010 FIFA World Cup qualification").\n\n## Club career\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Club career")]\n\n### Aston Villa\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Aston Villa")]\n\nYorke was first discovered by [Graham Taylor](/wiki/Graham_Taylor "Graham Taylor"), at the time the [Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. "Aston Villa F.C.") manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke, aged 17, appeared in a team that played a [friendly](/wiki/Friendly_(association_football) "Friendly (association football)") against Aston Villa. Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and played for the Villa Reserve and Youth sides for the majority of the 1989–90 season, making his [First Division](/wiki/Football_League_First_Division "Football League First Division") debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1–0. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the [1995–96 season](/wiki/1995%E2%80%9396_FA_Premier_League "1995–96 FA Premier League"), he then switched to [centre forward](/wiki/Forward_(association_football) "Forward (association football)") and established himself as one of the [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League "Premier League")\'s top strikers.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nYorke was an integral member of the Villa team that reached the [League Cup](/wiki/EFL_Cup "EFL Cup") Final in 1996. Villa won 3–0 against [Leeds United](/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C. "Leeds United F.C.") with Yorke getting on the scoresheet. On 30 September 1996 he scored a hat-trick against [Newcastle United](/wiki/Newcastle_United "Newcastle United") in a 4–3 defeat. Yorke appeared for Aston Villa on 284 occasions, scoring 97 times.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nThe circumstances of his departure from Aston Villa were controversial. John Gregory, Aston Villa\'s manager at that time, made it known that the club did not want to sell Yorke to Manchester United unless they were prepared to exchange striker [Andy Cole](/wiki/Andy_Cole "Andy Cole"). Yorke played for Villa on the opening day of the season at [Everton](/wiki/Everton_F.C. "Everton F.C.") on 15 August 1998, however it appeared he made little effort during the match as he was unhappy at not being allowed to leave the club. Villa were left with no option but to sell the player and he was transferred to Manchester United for £12.6\xa0million on 20 August 1998.[[4]](#cite_note-4)\n\n### Manchester United\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Manchester United")]\n\nIn his first season Yorke was a key player in guiding his club to a unique treble of the Premier League title, [FA Cup](/wiki/FA_Cup "FA Cup") and [UEFA Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League "UEFA Champions League"), and forming a legendary partnership with Andy Cole.[[5]](#cite_note-5) Yorke finished the season as the top league goalscorer with 18 goals and contributed goals against [Bayern Munich](/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich "FC Bayern Munich"), [Barcelona](/wiki/FC_Barcelona "FC Barcelona"), [Inter Milan](/wiki/Inter_Milan "Inter Milan"),[[6]](#cite_note-6) and [Juventus](/wiki/Juventus_FC "Juventus FC") in the Champions League, and he won the [Premier League Player of the Season](/wiki/Premier_League_Player_of_the_Season "Premier League Player of the Season"). Yorke was also a regular member of United\'s [1999–2000](/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_in_English_football "1999–2000 in English football") title winning team, contributing 23 goals in all competitions.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nDespite a less successful third season, Yorke scored his [100th Premier League goal](/wiki/List_of_footballers_with_100_or_more_Premier_League_goals "List of footballers with 100 or more Premier League goals") in a 3-0 victory over [Derby County](/wiki/Derby_County_F.C. "Derby County F.C.") on 24 November 2000[[7]](#cite_note-7) and also netted a [hat-trick](/wiki/Hat-trick_(association_football) "Hat-trick (association football)") in the top of the table clash with [Arsenal](/wiki/Arsenal_F.C. "Arsenal F.C.").[[8]](#cite_note-8) In January 2002 a move to [Middlesbrough](/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C. "Middlesbrough F.C.") fell through.[[9]](#cite_note-9) He played his last game for United that month, and was not issued a squad number for the 2002–03 season.[[10]](#cite_note-blackburn-10) Altogether he scored 65 goals for Manchester United in 152 appearances.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n\n### Blackburn Rovers\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Blackburn Rovers")]\n\nIn July 2002, Yorke moved to [Blackburn Rovers](/wiki/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C. "Blackburn Rovers F.C.") for an initial £2\xa0million, potentially rising to £2.6 million; United had wanted a fee of £6 million.[[10]](#cite_note-blackburn-10) He was signed to cover the long absence of [Matt Jansen](/wiki/Matt_Jansen "Matt Jansen") from a traffic accident, and was reunited with his former United strike partner Andy Cole.[[10]](#cite_note-blackburn-10)\n\nYorke scored 13 goals in all competitions in his first season at [Ewood Park](/wiki/Ewood_Park "Ewood Park"), including the winner on 26 October 2002 as Rovers won 2–1 at reigning champions Arsenal.[[12]](#cite_note-12) The following 4 January on his return to [Villa Park](/wiki/Villa_Park "Villa Park"), he scored twice in a 4–1 win in the FA Cup third round.[[13]](#cite_note-13) On 11 May, in the last game of the season, he opened a 4–0 win at [Tottenham Hotspur](/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur "Tottenham Hotspur") as Blackburn beat Everton to sixth place and [UEFA Cup](/wiki/UEFA_Cup "UEFA Cup") qualification.[[14]](#cite_note-14)\n\n### Birmingham City\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Birmingham City")]\n\nOn 31 August 2004, transfer deadline day, Yorke moved to [Birmingham City](/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C. "Birmingham City F.C.") on a one-year deal with the option of a second. Instead of a loan to [Celtic](/wiki/Celtic_F.C. "Celtic F.C."), he chose to join Birmingham for a "substantial but undisclosed fee".[[15]](#cite_note-15) It was later reported as £250,000.[[16]](#cite_note-released-16)\n\nYorke scored on his home debut for Birmingham in a 1–1 draw against [Charlton Athletic](/wiki/Charlton_Athletic_F.C. "Charlton Athletic F.C."), with the equaliser seven minutes after replacing [Clinton Morrison](/wiki/Clinton_Morrison "Clinton Morrison").[[17]](#cite_note-17) He scored again against Graeme Souness\'s Newcastle on 3 October.[[18]](#cite_note-18) However, Yorke fell out of favour at [St Andrew\'s](/wiki/St_Andrew%27s_(stadium) "St Andrew\'s (stadium)") and was released by mutual consent in April 2005.[[16]](#cite_note-released-16)\n\n### Sydney FC\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Sydney FC")]\n\nYorke immediately signed for [Sydney FC](/wiki/Sydney_FC "Sydney FC"),[[19]](#cite_note-19) with a salary of $1\xa0million a season. He scored the first goal for Sydney FC in its first A-League regular season match, a diving header against the [Melbourne Victory](/wiki/Melbourne_Victory_FC "Melbourne Victory FC"). Yorke came to Sydney FC with the biggest pedigree of all players in the A-League, having won the [treble](/wiki/Treble_(association_football) "Treble (association football)") with Manchester United. Yorke scored 7 goals in the A-League, with three of them being from [penalty kicks](/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football) "Penalty kick (association football)"). Sydney FC coach [Pierre Littbarski](/wiki/Pierre_Littbarski "Pierre Littbarski") moved Yorke into a midfield role and gave him the team captaincy.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nHe played a major role in leading Sydney FC to victory in the inaugural A-League Grand Final on 5 March against regional rivals [Central Coast Mariners](/wiki/Central_Coast_Mariners_FC "Central Coast Mariners FC"). He set up the only goal, scored by [Steve Corica](/wiki/Steve_Corica "Steve Corica"), in front of a sell out crowd of over 41,000 at the [Sydney Football Stadium](/wiki/Sydney_Football_Stadium_(1988) "Sydney Football Stadium (1988)"), and was awarded the [Joe Marston Medal](/wiki/Joe_Marston_Medal "Joe Marston Medal") as best player in the grand final. Yorke was the [marquee player](/wiki/A-League#Marquee_player "A-League") for Sydney FC – meaning that his salary fell outside the salary cap. He was also a star name for the A-League as a whole. Aside from his footballing talents, the drawing power and credibility he brought both locally and internationally proved to be beneficial for the competition in its inaugural season, leading the [Football Federation Australia](/wiki/Football_Federation_Australia "Football Federation Australia") to use his image and name for the promotion of the A-League\'s second season.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nDue to the schedule of football in Australia, Yorke returned to Manchester United for training from March to June 2006, to retain fitness for the World Cup.[[20]](#cite_note-20)\n\nYorke returned to Sydney FC to take part in a friendly against Everton in 2010. The game was considered his \'farewell game\' as he never had the chance to say a proper farewell to the fans at Sydney FC. Everton won the match 1–0, and Yorke was substituted midway through the second half.[[21]](#cite_note-21)\n\n### Sunderland\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Sunderland")]\n\nOn 31 August 2006, Yorke\'s transfer to [Sunderland](/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C. "Sunderland A.F.C.") was announced.[[22]](#cite_note-22) The transfer for a fee of £200,000 ([A$](/wiki/Australian_Dollar "Australian Dollar") $500,000) re-united Yorke with ex-teammate [Roy Keane](/wiki/Roy_Keane "Roy Keane"), manager of Sunderland. Yorke made his debut in the home match against Leicester City and received a rapturous standing ovation from home fans when he came on as a substitute in the first half. Yorke was used as a defensive midfielder rather than his usual striker role.[[23]](#cite_note-23) He scored his first goal for Sunderland in the 2–1 loss against Stoke.\n\nOn 2 January 2008, during Sunderland\'s 1–0 defeat to Blackburn, Yorke was given a red card by referee Rob Styles. Yorke stated several times he would like to return to the [A-League](/wiki/A-League "A-League"), preferably Sydney FC. However, following Sydney FC\'s signings at the time it seemed unlikely that Sydney would have been able to fit him under the salary cap. It was reported that Yorke play for rivals Central Coast Mariners, the team bankrolled by the man who brought him to Sydney, Peter Turnbull.[[24]](#cite_note-24)\n\nOn 11 March 2008, it was announced that the Mariners were in "advanced negotiations" with Yorke to become the marquee for two years.[[25]](#cite_note-25) However, on 1 July he signed a new one-year contract to stay with Sunderland for the 2008–09 season.[[26]](#cite_note-26) He was named [man of the match](/wiki/Man_of_the_match "Man of the match") for his performance[[27]](#cite_note-27) against Arsenal on 4 October 2008, with Sunderland drawing 1–1 at home. Following Keane\'s departure in December 2008, Yorke and [Neil Bailey](/wiki/Neil_Bailey "Neil Bailey") were named as assistants to [Ricky Sbragia](/wiki/Ricky_Sbragia "Ricky Sbragia").[[28]](#cite_note-28) Yorke was released at the end of the 2008–09 season.[[29]](#cite_note-29)\n\n### Post-retirement\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Post-retirement")]\n\nYorke has completed his Level B coaching badge, and in 2010 was quoted as being interested in pursuing a career in coaching, ideally with Aston Villa.[[30]](#cite_note-30) On 17 April 2011 he completed the [London Marathon](/wiki/London_Marathon "London Marathon") in a time of 3 hours and 32 minutes.[[31]](#cite_note-31) On 14 August 2011, Yorke signed a two-year deal to work for [Sky Sports](/wiki/Sky_Sports "Sky Sports") as a pundit.[[32]](#cite_note-32)\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: International career")]\n\nYorke was [capped](/wiki/Cap_(association_football) "Cap (association football)") 72 times for the [Trinidad and Tobago national team](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_national_football_team "Trinidad and Tobago national football team"), scoring 19 goals. Along with his friend [Russell Latapy](/wiki/Russell_Latapy "Russell Latapy"), Yorke was a member of the 1989 \'Strike Squad\', the national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the [1990 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup "1990 FIFA World Cup").[[33]](#cite_note-33) He retired from international football in 2001 after a disagreement with coach [René Simões](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Sim%C3%B5es "René Simões"), who cut Yorke and [Russell Latapy](/wiki/Russell_Latapy "Russell Latapy") from the squad prior to a decisive game of the [2002 World Cup qualification](/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_%E2%80%93_CONCACAF_final_round "2002 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF final round"), as both missed practice following a night partying.[[34]](#cite_note-34) However he returned to the team for the [2006 World Cup qualification](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification "2006 FIFA World Cup qualification") campaign, in which the team qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time in their history after a 2–1 aggregate qualifying victory over [Bahrain](/wiki/Bahrain_national_football_team "Bahrain national football team").[[35]](#cite_note-35)\n\nYorke was captain for all of Trinidad and Tobago\'s games at the [2006 World Cup](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup "2006 FIFA World Cup") and was man of the match in the 0–0 draw against [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden_men%27s_national_football_team "Sweden men\'s national football team"), pipping his close friend [Shaka Hislop](/wiki/Shaka_Hislop "Shaka Hislop") to the honour despite the then [West Ham](/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C. "West Ham United F.C.") goalkeeper making several world-class saves. He was one of six players in the Trinidad squad (the others being [Brent Sancho](/wiki/Brent_Sancho "Brent Sancho"), [Dennis Lawrence](/wiki/Dennis_Lawrence "Dennis Lawrence"), [Chris Birchall](/wiki/Chris_Birchall "Chris Birchall"), [Carlos Edwards](/wiki/Carlos_Edwards "Carlos Edwards") and [Stern John](/wiki/Stern_John "Stern John")) to have played every minute of the campaign. Yorke was rated the best defensive midfielder in the opening stages of the World Cup.[[36]](#cite_note-36)\n\nYorke announced his retirement from international football in March 2007, choosing to focus on his club career at Sunderland.[[37]](#cite_note-37) He captained the side in Germany, and up until his retirement. However, he made a guest return appearance for a friendly against [England](/wiki/England_national_football_team "England national football team") in June 2008 after being invited by [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA "FIFA") vice-president Jack Warner.[[38]](#cite_note-38) On 10 July 2008, the [TTFF](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_Football_Federation "Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation") announced Yorke\'s return to the national team for the [2010 World Cup qualification](/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification "2010 FIFA World Cup qualification") campaign.[[39]](#cite_note-39)\n\nOn 15 October 2008, he scored his first international goal after returning from retirement against the [United States](/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team "United States men\'s national soccer team") in a 2010 World Cup qualification match. The game ended 2–1 for Trinidad and Tobago. His goal was a crucial tie-breaker scored in the 79th minute, which put Trinidad and Tobago in a great situation to advance to the next qualifying stage, needing only a tie against Cuba in their final game. On 11 February 2009, Yorke scored a 26th-minute penalty for his country, but was sent off in the dying seconds of Trinidad and Tobago\'s opening match of 2010 World Cup qualification against [El Salvador](/wiki/El_Salvador_national_football_team "El Salvador national football team") (2–2) after exchanging heated remarks with Mexican referee [Marco Antonio Rodríguez](/wiki/Marco_Antonio_Rodr%C3%ADguez "Marco Antonio Rodríguez") (the Trini star had voiced his disapproval of the disruptions caused by the home crowd) and was consequently banned for four games due to his use of abusive language. The suspension was later reduced to two matches.[[40]](#cite_note-40)\n\nAfter being released from Sunderland and being unable to find a club before the end of the current [transfer window](/wiki/Transfer_window "Transfer window"), Yorke retired from football altogether in September 2009, and took up the post of assistant manager with the Trinidad and Tobago national team.[[41]](#cite_note-41)\n\n## Management career\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Management career")]\n\n### Early career\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Early career")]\n\nOn 21 April 2019, Yorke was interviewed for the vacant role at [National League](/wiki/National_League_(division) "National League (division)") side [Sutton United](/wiki/Sutton_United "Sutton United").

Coming from a family of nine, Yorke certainly knows about financial hardships — the story of the young Dwight catching crabs in Tobago to buy football boots is a staple of the “rags” part of his story; since his move to Manchester United, the wealthiest club in the world, in August last year, Yorke could quite easily afford to buy boots for the whole island. His generosity is legendary and his mother Grace still receives a portion of his salary every month.\n\nThe other trait that the English fans have learned to love about Yorke is his permanent good nature; his joyful face after each goal shows his pure delight in the game. While many foreign players become unpopular for their arrogance, Yorke still has the humility to admit that “Careers are up and down, people struggle with confidence, you go from one thing to another. It’s the same for everyone, you know? If I hadn’t made it as a footballer, who knows what I’d be doing now!”\n\nSending money home is an important task for Yorke. “Coming from a poor family, that was my number one priority when the money started coming in, to sort things out, especially for my mother. She went through a lot and we’re very close. She’s sorted now — it doesn’t stop her complaining though! But that’s what mums are for, to have a moan at you.”\n\nOld Trafford, the “Theatre of Dreams”, home of Manchester United, has for many years been a graveyard for strikers. Players of the highest regard join the club in the hope of finishing off the numerous chances that others make, only to fail due to weight of expectation. He may have only joined the club last August but already Yorke is exciting the fans as George Best and Bobby Charlton did many years before, and Eric Cantona did more recently. The Tobagonian is fast reaching the peak of his career and is certainly fulfilling his dreams.\n\nLast year the British media raised doubts about the amount of money Yorke was worth when he left Aston Villa, his club of eight years, for Manchester United. Those in the know — such as his adoring fans in Trinidad and Tobago and those more closely involved in his career — knew otherwise. While Villa, who were well aware of their top striker’s talents, were prepared to hold out for more money, they finally agreed to a fee of £12,600,000. In the English game only Alan Shearer had been transferred for more, and that was due to the new-found wealth of his childhood team Newcastle. Now the figure looks a positive bargain as Yorke continues to strike fear into the hearts of Premiership defenders and has developed an awesome partnership with Andy Cole in attack for Manchester United.\n\nIt was Graham Taylor, the former manager of England and no stranger to media attacks, who discovered Yorke on a tour of Trinidad and Tobago with Aston Villa in 1989. Under the tutelage of his mentor, Bertille St Clair, now coach to the national team and a highly regarded figure in the islands, Yorke had postponed his schooling to concentrate on helping Trinidad and Tobago to qualify for the 1990 [World Cup](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/topic_tags/world-cup) finals in Italy. After seeing the young forward in a friendly match, Taylor soon agreed a fee of £120,000 with his club St Clairs, and the 17-year-old was on his way to England.\n\nOne person who was not keen on the transition was his mother. Yorke says, “I had to give up school for eight months in 1989-90 because of the World Cup situation. I was only 17 and she was totally against that. The next thing Villa came on tour and wanted to whizz me away to England. I said to her, ‘I can go back to school when I’m 35 but I can’t play football then.’”\n\nAlthough Trinidad and Tobago narrowly failed to qualify for the World Cup, Yorke and Aston Villa gained from the unlikely meeting. Despite his mother’s initial misgivings, Yorke had seen the success his best friend [Brian Lara](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/topic_tags/brian-lara) had enjoyed in [cricket](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/topic_tags/cricket). “His achievement inspired me. Whatever I do I can’t compete with him because his records are phenomenal, but seeing what he did, and sooner than expected, has spurred me on to be a more recognisable figure in this country as a football player.”\n\nIt wasn’t Yorke’s only offer, though: “I was offered a football scholarship by Harvard University, so if I hadn’t made it in England, I would probably have gone there, although God knows what I would have studied. Accounting probably, I’ve always liked that. I don’t know why, I know it sounds strange. It just appeals to me. Maths was always a favourite of mine at school, figures and that.”\n\nDespite his hopes for a professional career in football, Yorke was extremely modest. “All setbacks do is make you stronger, a little more determined not to let them occur again. What you do is try and pick the positive from that. How can I complain about anything? I haven’t a problem in the world, and you only live this way for so long, certainly in our sport, so you might as well enjoy it. I enjoy every single moment of it.”\n\nIn his first few months at Villa, Yorke came to the attention of David Platt, who went on to captain England. “You could see he had frightening potential, even as a teenager,” recalls Platt. “He used to love doing silly tricks. I remember him standing in a bin so he couldn’t move his feet and controlling the ball with just his head. He would balance it, not on his forehead, but on the top of his head and then he would roll it down his forehead, over his face, kiss it and roll it the way back. How he did it, I still don’t know.”\n\nBecause he was so young, Taylor resisted the temptation of playing Yorke in such a physically demanding league, and he had to wait until his manager left to coach England before making his first appearance for the club. Dr Josef Venglos, the Slovakian coach, eventually gave Yorke his full debut in 1990, ironically against Manchester United, and his performance brought scathing criticism from the former United manager Tommy Docherty. “If that lad makes a First Division footballer, my name is Mao Tse-Tung” were his exact words.\n\nWhile Docherty has not yet changed his name, Yorke has certainly made him eat his words. Subsequently it was Venglos, and not Yorke, who failed in English football, and the next man to take the helm at Villa was the larger-than-life Ron Atkinson, otherwise known as Big Ron. Yorke initially found Atkinson’s style of management not to his liking, but eventually the two wildly different characters reached a compromise. “Ron knows how to get the best out of players, but it was difficult for me at first,” says Yorke. “He winds people up and expects you to have a go back at him. Harsh things were said which I took too personally. I’m a player who needs an arm around me saying, ‘Come on Dwight, you can do it’, and he came to realise that.”\n\nYorke also remembers the time when Villa were on their way to beating Manchester United in the Coca Cola Cup, English football’s most significant tournament after the FA Cup. “We were going down to London and we all went out for a meal to get team spirit going. Ron went on the stage to do karaoke and it was very funny — he did ‘New York, New York, It’s up to you Dwight Yorke’ — and that was really memorable for me.”\n\nVilla also went on to lift the same cup in 1996, but these were the only pieces of silverware he picked up during his time in Birmingham. The game itself was memorable for Yorke. Playing against a Leeds side, managed by Howard Wilkinson, now technical director for the national team, Villa destroyed them 3-0 on a beautiful afternoon at Wembley. The final goal, in the last minute of time, was of course scored by the man himself.\n\nBrian Little was brought in to replace Ron Atkinson. It was not to last, though. After buying Stan Collymore for a club record fee of £7 million, Little had the dilemma of three forwards — Yorke, Savo Milosevic and Collymore — competing for two places. The result was that Yorke was moved back to midfield to accommodate the notoriously erratic Collymore, and Villa spent the majority of last season near the bottom of the table. Little soon resigned and in came Gregory, Yorke’s final Villa manager.\n\nGregory restored Yorke to his favoured position and was rewarded with the goals that not only kept Villa in the Premier League but also qualified them for the UEFA Cup — second in prestige to the European Cup. Gregory made no secret of his admiration for Yorke, his ability at holding the ball up while waiting for team-mates and his knack for conjuring goals from nothing, but the player soon became dissatisfied that summer while watching the 1998 World Cup in France.\n\nThere is no doubt that one of the main reasons for Yorke leaving Villa was to further his ambition. While Villa are a big club by English standards, it became clear that Yorke wanted to test himself at the highest level. Because Manchester United usually finishes the season at the top of the Premier League, the club often qualifies for the European Champions League — the most prestigious tournament in European football and a competition United were desperate to win for only the second time in their history.\n\nYorke was enthralled by Champions League football: “It’s the best thing ever, man; it’s fantastic, home or away. Provided the manager picks me! That’s why I came to this club. To prove to people, and myself, that I could compete with the best in the world. I’m unlikely to play in a World Cup with Trinidad and Tobago, so playing for United in the Champions League is my World Cup. Playing for Manchester United gives me the opportunity to play alongside — and against — the very best players around. For instance, I played against Lothar Matthaus the other day. There were times I never dreamed I’d share the same pitch with someone like that.”\n\nIt was during and after World Cup 1998 in France that United manager Alex Ferguson set his sights on a forward of the highest pedigree. The legendary Argentinian forward Gabriel Batistuta and Patrick Kluivert of Holland were both candidates. When Batistuta decided to stay in Italy with Fiorentina and Kluivert opted for Barcelona, Ferguson set his sights on Yorke. Yorke’s manager John Gregory, however, was not interested in the least, and so began the long process of securing Yorke’s release from Villa. Gregory had only taken over at Villa Park a few months before, and having guided the club away from relegation — greatly helped by Yorke, who scored seven goals in seven games towards the end of the season — was desperate not to lose one of his finest players to the biggest club in the land.\n\nBut he was up against Ferguson, one of the shrewdest characters in the game. After the rumours started, Gregory dismissed them as “scurrilous” and said: “There’s no way he’s going anywhere, so the fans should not worry.” Yorke, though, had other thoughts on the matter, and soon the drama was heightened when both Yorke and United wanted to complete the deal as quickly as possible so that he would be eligible for the Champions League.\n\nRisking the wrath of the Villa fans, Yorke issued a statement; “It would be fair to say I still want to go to Manchester United. I have always said the Champions League is the type of stage I want. I spent all summer watching the World Cup, knowing I will never get there with Trinidad and Tobago. That is why I need to play at the highest club level I can. There is no point moving just to play in the Premiership. I can stay here and do that. Opportunities like this only come along once in a lifetime, and I had asked John Gregory and the Villa board for their understanding. I don’t want Villa fans to see me as disloyal. I would ask every supporter to think what they would do if they were offered another job which they would really like to do.”\n\nDespite his best friend Brian Lara’s advice to stay with Villa, Yorke had set his mind on the move. “Many people have warned me about the pressures of playing for United, especially as a striker. Brian, for instance, said I did not need to move to Manchester United to realise my dreams, but this was a call I had to answer. It has been a long, long journey and I do not intend to fail now.”\n\nAfter a long dispute, Villa finally backed down. At the time the Villa chairman, Doug Ellis, commented, “I know Dwight very well and it became obvious to me that while we could keep him physically, we had lost him mentally.” Gregory was not so gracious in defeat. “I never wanted to sell him and if I’d had a gun I’d have shot him.\n\nAnd so, finally, Yorke was allowed to join Manchester United for a fee of £12,600,000. Yorke joined other new signings Jaap Stam and the Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist in a formidable squad already boasting the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Roy Keane.\n\nIn the past, strikers have struggled to live with the responsibility of playing for United. The atmosphere at Old Trafford often gets the better of players who have arrived for vast transfer sums, and, as a result, their form suffers. No such problems for the supremely confident Yorke, who took to the club like a duck to water. He made his debut for United in the intimidating atmosphere of West Ham, in London’s East End. Although he failed to score in a drab goalless draw, he did manage two in his next league game for the club, a 4-1 win over Charlton United. Manager Alex Ferguson, renowned for his knack of bringing out the best in players, said at the time, “There are so many different facets to him. He is brave, he has stamina, he can play with both feet and he can beat men. When you add all the parts up, you know he is a very special player. The complete centre-forward.”\n\nIt hasn’t been all work and no play for Yorke; his career as a “single man” has sometimes threatened to overshadow his exploits on the field. During his time in the English Midlands, Yorke was so well-loved that he became known as the “King of Birmingham”. He was often seen in the city’s nightclubs and certainly knew how to enjoy himself. A string of women sold their stories to national newspapers, recounting tales of passion with the young, strongly-built footballer. Yorke, though, was, of course, not married, and despite the media interest in his private life, there were rarely stories of a critical nature.\n\nHis performances for United in the Champions League have been nothing short of devastating. In qualifying for the Quarter-Finals — no mean feat — United scored a record number of goals, including six past the mighty Spanish champions Barcelona over two games. Yorke had certainly arrived. His partnership with Andy Cole is undoubtedly the finest in the country, made all the more surprising by Cole’s previous difficulties.\n\nThe transformation of Cole since Yorke’s arrival has been staggering. Good friends on and off the pitch, they have both been scoring for fun in recent months. “Andy and I bond together both on and off the field, which I think is rare. It’s why we’re doing so well as a pairing. He’s taken personal time out to show me around Manchester, the shops, where to go. I got lost the first time I tried to find The Cliff (United’s training ground). I had to phone Andy to find out how to get there. Even when everyone was saying I was a threat to his place in the team, he was inviting me to his home and family and feeding me there — which helps when you are stuck in a hotel. If it wasn’t for Andy I’d have been in that room pulling my hair out, not that I’ve got much, but I would have been. There’s only so much you can do in a hotel room.”\n\nNo such problem now for Yorke, who has just bought his own impressive house in Manchester. It’s a long way from the islands of the Caribbean, but, at least for the time being, it’s home.\n\n[←](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-37/andy-narrell-caribbean-man)[![Image 33: At home in the U.S. Photograph by Michael Goodwin](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/046_musicbeat_37-260x260.jpg)](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-37/andy-narrell-caribbean-man)[Previous Story Andy Narrell: Caribbean Man](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-37/andy-narrell-caribbean-man)\n\n[→](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-37/barbados-kids)[![Image 34: From Signal station to beach to nature reserve, Barbados is educational and fun for children.

Dwight Yorke will hope that this ability to hit the target will transition over to the golf course at the ICONS of Football 2017 tournament this summer, so he and his Rest of the World teammates will smile all the way to victory.\n\nYorke was first discovered by Graham Taylor, the then manager of Aston Villa, who was impressed enough to eventually offer the Trinidad and Tobago International a permanent contract.\n\nYorke was initially a right winger before making the swap to centre forward where he produced at an elite level. During his time with Aston Villa, Yorke was a crucial part of the club that reached the League Cup Final defeating Leeds United 3-0 in 1996, where he scored in the 88th minute.\n\nYorke appeared in 196 matches for the Villans, netting 63 goals for the club. Yorke’s high quality of play at Villa drew the attention of Man United leading him to eventually make the switch to Old Trafford. Yorke was transferred to Man United at the start of the 1998-99 season ending the nine years he spent at Aston Villa.\n\nThe former Aston Villa star found great success at Manchester United both at an individual level and on the club level. In his first season with the club, they won the unique treble of the Premiership Title, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. The Trinidad and Tobago star was a vital centrepiece in their \xa0Champions League run scoring goals against Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Internazionale and Juventus.\n\nYorke finished with a League-high 18 goals that campaign and was named the Premier League Player of the Season. While at United, Yorke paired with Andy Cole to become one of the most legendary striking duos in the Premier League and one of the most feared attacking partnerships in Europe. The two were part of a Man United club that won three consecutive Premier League Titles.\n\nIt was on this day in 2001 that Yorke had the highest scoring match of his career with three goals and an assist against Arsenal.\n\nIn addition to having a very successful club career, the star striker also was an important contributor to the Trinidad and Tobago national club making 72 caps for his home nation. Yorke was a key member of the 2006 team that qualified for the World Cup – the first time a Trinidad squad had qualified for a World Cup in the country’s history. He was one of six members of the team that played every minute of the campaign. As a result of his storied career, Yorke was the first Tobagonian to be inducted into T&T Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nAfter his time at Manchester United, the goal scoring machine spent two seasons at Blackburn Rover rejoining Andy Cole, his fellow striker at Man United that he found so much success with earlier in their careers. In his first season with the club Yorke netted 13 goals and helped the club qualify for the UEFA Cup. Yorke represented five different Premier League clubs over his storied career and also had a stint in Australia’s A league with Sydney F.C.\n\nYorke will be remembered as one of the greatest strikers the Premier League has seen and was part of an all time great Man United team of the late 90’s and early 2000’s. The Trinidad and Tobago star forward had 123 goals in his 375 caps in Premier League play, Yorke was the first non English player to score 100 goals in the Premiership.\n\nWhat is even more remarkable is that, despite being known as one of the deadliest and unforgiving strikers of the modern era, Yorke was always seen to be sporting his trademark grin, seemingly wider than any goal he would shoot the ball into. It was this look that made him as endearing to fans, not just of his clubs, but of football. A player who found infectious joy every time he laced up his boots.\n\nAs the Rest of the World team prepares to take on the England team in the ICONS of Football 2017 tournament this June, Dwight Yorke will be counted on to help get the win for the ROTW team at The Belfry. One thing is guaranteed – whether he’s on the fairway or in the changing room, Yorke will be wearing a smile that will light up the event.\n\n![Soca Warriors Online](/images/logos/site/logo_socawarriors_net_01.png)\n\n### Social', 'images': []}], 'failed_results': [], 'response_time': 1.34, 'request_id': '6d3e1f7d-a32e-4190-bf9c-156ac52d9a2f'}

Yorke spent nine years at Villa Park and despite occasional problems with injuries and inconsistency, he averaged close to a goal ever three games (73 in 231 league appearances) and tasted victory in the 1996 League Cup final, scoring in a 3-0 win against Leeds United at Wembley.\n  \n  \nYorke’s silky touches and strike rate at Villa Park sparked the interest of Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson, who took the forward to Old Trafford in 1998 for a fee of £12.6 million. In his first three seasons at United, he formed with Andy Cole one of English football’s most prolific attacking duos in recent memory and played a crucial role as United won three consecutive league titles – not to mention the 1999 Champions League and FA Cup as part of a historic treble.\n  \n  \nIn all, Yorke scored 47 goals in 96 league appearances for Manchester United, a remarkable return, but after leaving Old Trafford for Blackburn in 2001, the goals appeared to dry up for the T&T international. His time in England ended with a short, unhappy spell at Birmingham City in the 2004/05 season and the striker with the famous toothy grin then sought a fresh start in Australia at Sydney FC. He was rewarded with silverware as he captained the Sydneysiders to the inaugural A-League Grand Final in March this year.\n  \n  \nAlthough already revered in his beloved Trinidad and Tobago, Yorke’s role in captaining the national team to their first finals in Germany in 2006 has made the man akin to a demigod in the Caribbean. A member of the team that so famously lost out on a spot at Italia 90 on the last day of qualifying, Yorke was inspirational in the Soca Warriors’ path to Germany.\n  \n  \nDescribed as a “special player” by coach Leo Beenhakker, Yorke’s roaming role just behind the front line allows all of his experience and tactical knowledge to shine through. He certainly looked in fine fettle when scoring both goals as T&T won their first match of this FIFA World Cup year against Iceland on 28 February.\n  \n  \nDespite his veteran status, Yorke retains a touch of class and, for all his achievements, the opportunity to play in his first FIFA World Cup finals has undoubtedly got him dreaming again.  \n**(FIFA WC 2006 profile)**\n\n  \n  \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Honors for Dwight |\n| * Trinidad & Tobago\'s Sports Hall of Fame in 2011 * English Championship winner\'s medal with Sunderland in 2006/2007 * Trinidad & Tobago Footballer of the Year in 2006 * Named as a Sports Ambassador of Trinidad & Tobago in 2006 * Trinidad & Tobago Chaconia Medal Gold (World Cup Squad) in 2006 * Australian A-League winner\'s medal with Sydney FC in 2005/2006 * Sydney FC\'s Forward of the Year in 2005/2006 * Tobago House of Assembly Chief Secretary\'s Award in 2005 * Trinidad & Tobago Footballer of the Year in 2005 * Top Goalscorer for Blackburn Rovers in 2002/2003 * English Premier League winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 2000/2001 * First non-English player to score 100 goals (in a 3-0 win at Derby County) in the Premiership in 2000/2001 * English Premier League Player of the Month (for March) with Manchester United in 2000 * English Premier League winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1999/2000 * Top Goalscorer for Manchester United in 1999/2000 * Intercontinental Cup winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1999 * 10th place in FIFA\'s World Player of the Year ranking in 1999 * English Premier League Player of the Month (for January) with Manchester United in 1999 * Trinidad & Tobago Chaconia Medal Gold (for Sport) in 1999 * English FA Cup winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1998/1999 * Joint Top Goalscorer in the UEFA Champions League with 8 goals in 1998/1999 * Named to the English Professional Football Association’s Team of the Year in 1998/1999 * Runner-up PFA Player of the Year in 1998/1999 * English Premier League Golden Boot Award (18 goals) in 1998/1999 * Carling Player of the Year in 1998/1999 * UEFA Champions League winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1998/1999 * English Premier League winner\'s medal with Manchester United in 1998/1999 * Trinidad & Tobago Olympic Committee Sports Personality of the Year in 1998 * Top Goalscorer for Aston Villa in 1996/1997 * Aston Villa\'s Player of the Year in 1996/1997 * English FA Premiership Player of the Month (for February) with Aston Villa in 1996 * Aston Villa\'s Player of the Year in 1995/1996 * League Cup winner\'s medal with Aston Villa in 1995/1996 * Top Goalscorer for Aston Villa in 1995/1996 * Top Goalscorer for Aston Villa in 1994/1995 * Trinidad & Tobago Humming Bird Medal Silver (for Sport) in 1993 * Trinidad & Tobago Chaconia Medal Silver (World Cup Squad) in 1989 |\n\n  \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related Articles | |\n| [Defend Home Fort: Yorke urges team to win T&T matches to qualify](/senior-team-news/26273-defend-home-fort-yorke-urges-team-to-win-t-t-matches-to-qualify.html) | Aug 22nd, 2025 |\n| [Caution: Don’t count World Cup chickens yet](/senior-team-news/26264-caution-don-t-count-world-cup-chickens-yet.html) | Aug 16th, 2025 |\n| [Dante Sealy soars in June...A new star rises in Trinidad and Tobago football](/senior-team-news/26212-dante-sealy-soars-in-june-a-new-star-rises-in-trinidad-and-tobago-football.html) | Jul 6th, 2025 |\n| [Sancho gives Soca Warriors \'puncher\'s chance\' for final World Cup qualifying round](/senior-team-news/26207-sancho-gives-soca-warriors-puncher-s-chance-for-final-world-cup-qualifying-round.html) | Jun 28th, 2025 |\n| [Yorke says T&T can compete—but can Warriors get to 2026 World Cup?](/senior-team-news/26203-yorke-says-t-t-can-compete-but-can-warriors-get-to-2026-world-cup.html) | Jun 26th, 2025 |\n| [Gold Cup gains](/senior-team-news/26200-gold-cup-gains.html) | Jun 24th, 2025 |\n| [No luck in Vegas: Trinidad and Tobago ousted after 1-1 draw with Saudi Arabia](/senior-team-news/26197-no-luck-in-vegas-trinidad-and-tobago-ousted-after-1-1-draw-with-saudi-arabia.html) | Jun 24th, 2025 |\n| [TTFA boss: No one broke camp, players fully committed](/senior-team-news/26195-ttfa-boss-no-one-broke-camp-players-fully-committed.html) | Jun 23rd, 2025 |\n| [All or nothing: Trinidad and Tobago battle Saudi Arabia for Gold Cup quarters spot](/senior-team-news/26194-all-or-nothing-trinidad-and-tobago-battle-saudi-arabia-for-gold-cup-quarters-spot.html) | Jun 22nd, 2025 |\n| [Yorke on draw with ten-man Haiti: We were afraid to make mistakes](/senior-team-news/26191-yorke-on-draw-with-ten-man-haiti-we-were-afraid-to-make-mistakes.html) | Jun 21st, 2025 |\n| [Yorke targets aggressive Haitians;

Trinidad and Tobago did not advance from a group including [England](/soccer/team?id=448), Sweden and [Paraguay](/soccer/team?id=210).\n\n"Dwight\'s experience, leadership, and commitment to the red, white, and black are exactly what we need to inspire our players and our nation," Trinidadian soccer federation president Kieron Edwards [said in a statement](https://thettfa.com/news/yorke-is-new-trinidad-and-tobago-head-coach/).\n\nThe 52-year-old Yorke joins the team as its second behind [Costa Rica](/soccer/team?id=214) in a five-team World Cup qualifying group. The top two advance to the next stage, and Trinidad\'s place could be sealed by beating Saint Kitts and Nevis on June 6.\n\nConcacaf has three more guaranteed entries to the World Cup being co-hosted by the [United States](/soccer/team?id=660), [Canada](/soccer/team?id=206) and [Mexico](/soccer/team?id=203), which each got an automatic place. Two more teams could qualify through intercontinental playoffs.\n\nYorke could potentially find himself competing against his former assistant coach at Man United Steve McClaren, who was [appointed](/soccer/story/_/id/40693557/steve-mcclaren-man-united-jamaica-head-coach) [Jamaica](/soccer/team/_/id/1038/jamaica) [coach in July](/soccer/story/_/id/40693557/steve-mcclaren-man-united-jamaica-head-coach).\n\nYorke\'s most recent coaching job was in Australia with [Macarthur FC](/soccer/team/_/id/19340/macarthur-fc), which he led to the national cup title in 2022 [before leaving last year](/soccer/story/_/id/37635694/dwight-yorke-macarthur-mutually-agree-part-ways). He later won a [settlement case](/soccer/story/_/id/41708777/macarthur-fc-face-fifa-transfer-ban-dwight-yorke-sacking) against the club at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nYorke starred for almost a decade at [Aston Villa](/soccer/team?id=362) before joining Man United ahead of its storied treble-winning season in 1998-99.\n\n*Information from The Associated Press contributed to this report.*\n\n ', 'images': []}

He led the team to victory in the inaugural A-League Grand Final match versus Central Coast Mariners in March 2006. For his brilliant performance, he was named as the best players in the grand final and was awarded the Joe Marston Medal.

They were eliminated in the group stage without scoring a goal, in what was their first and only participation – for now.\n\nAlmost 20 years on, the 53-year-old is back leading the Soca Warriors, this team as head coach, but with the same motivation: bring the islands to the World Cup.\n\n“Football is a sport that really unites our country, we know how important it is,” Yorke tells Olympics.com at a training session in London during the 2025 Unity Cup. “We have a really good opportunity to try and qualify for the World Cup, although we still have some unfinished business to do.\n\n“I'm quietly confident that we can get it done and really give [ourselves] a good foundation and platform to try to qualify. I'm not going to get ahead of myself. There's still a lot of work to be done.”\n\nTrinidad and Tobago have returned to the top 100 in the FIFA men’s world rankings under Yorke – can he now steer them towards a first World Cup finals in two decades?\n\n* [FIFA World Cup 2026: These teams have qualified for the tournament - full list](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/football-qualified-teams-men-fifa-world-cup-2026)\n* [CONCACAF Gold Cup 2025: Full schedule, all results and standings - complete list](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/concacaf-gold-cup-2025-soccer-full-schedule-all-results-scorers-standings-complete-list)\n\n[Love football? ⚽ Relive the best football moments from Paris 2024 🏅](https://www.olympics.com/en/sign-in?entry_point_type=instory_campaign&entry_point_tag=football&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.olympics.com%2Fen%2Folympic-games%2Fparis-2024%2Fvideos)\n\n> [View this post on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKnN1ptuTUl/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n>\n> [A post shared by Dwight Yorke (@officialdwightyorke19)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DKnN1ptuTUl/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n\n## Dwight Yorke, learning from the great Sir Alex Ferguson\n\nGiven that Yorke has been managed and mentored by some of the game’s finest managers, it is far from unexpected that he is now pursuing the same path.\n\nThe striker was signed by English giants Manchester United in 1998 by none other than Sir Alex Ferguson, the most successful manager in Premier League history with 13 titles.\n\nYorke came into a successful setup which brought even more silverware: in his first season alone, he won the treble (Premier League, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League) and went on to seize three consecutive league titles with the Red Devils.\n\nThe Trinidadian and Tobagonian was undoubtedly influenced by Sir Alex, not just on the pitch but off it and towards the dugout.\n\n“The mindset that I've taken from the gaffer is how to win football matches,” Yorke states of the former United manager, “and he's a serial winner himself, everybody knows that.”\n\nAfter retiring in 2009, Yorke needed time and patience upon entering the managerial sphere. With much persistence and patience, he landed his first job in Australia with Macarthur FC, leading them to their first major honour in the 2022 Australia Cup.\n\n“It took me a while,” Yorke admits of the adjustment from playing to coaching. “I've been focusing on managing for quite some time now. I've obviously had some experience in the past as well. We have made some really good progress in the months since I've taken over the job.”\n\nThe former national team captain arrived at the helm of the twin islands last November, having previously served as assistant coach for a brief spell following retirement.\n\nPicture by Ben Radford /Allsport\n\nSir Alex Ferguson (left) managed Dwight Yorke (centre) at Manchester United.\n\nHe continues, “The most important thing is the enjoyment of the game, and I think that's what has gone out of the game. We always know that we produce a bunch of talented players. It's just to have some self-belief in themselves and a better structure.\n\n“Having the players buy into my philosophy and understanding what it takes to be competitive, we are making progress, so that's a real positive despite the results.”\n\n## Yorke inspires Trinidad and Tobago: ‘Football is a vehicle to mobilise the country’\n\nWith a population of 1.3 million people, the Caribbean islands of Trinidad and Tobago have a special affinity for sport. They have won 19 medals at the Olympic Games, even venturing into the Winter Games as they prepare for [Milano Cortina 2026](https://www.olympics.com/en/olympic-games/milano-cortina-2026).\n\nWhen it comes to football, it is the game that unites the nation with those around the world. That is not lost on Yorke, who knows what a World Cup would mean to his homeland.\n\nThe head coach explains, “We know what is required - the players understand that - and it takes a lot of sacrifice and determination to get there. We are a twin island, we are unique in itself. It would probably be my greatest achievement if we were to get to the World Cup again. The fact that it just brings our people closer together.\n\nPicture by Warren Little/Getty Images\n\nBRENTFORD, ENGLAND - MAY 27: Dwight Yorke, Manager of Trinidad & Tobago looks on during the Unity Cup between Jamacia and Trinidad & Tobago at Gtech Community Stadium on May 27, 2025 in Brentford, England. (Photo by Warren Little/Getty Images)\n\n“We had some turbulent times in the past, and I think football is a good vehicle to mobilise the country again. Football has played a crucial part in our society and our lives. It gives not just me, but the players, the people of Trinidad and Tobago, an enormous boost if we were to qualify for the World Cup.”\n\nIt is a little under a year until the FIFA World Cup, which takes place in the USA, Mexico and Canada from 11 June – 19 July 2026.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago are into the third and final CONCACAF qualifying round, where they enter a group of four teams. Should they top that group, they will return to the world stage after 20 years away.\n\nFirst, the focus is on the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup and a group lineup to relish. The Soca Warriors begin their campaign against hosts USA on 15 June, as Yorke goes toe-to-toe with former Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino.\n\n“There's lots of work to done, but hopefully we'll be able to get the job done,” Yorke concludes. “It's not going to be relatively straightforward as some people may think it is.”\n\n## ARE YOU HAPPY TO ACCEPT COOKIES?\n\nTo improve and personalise your experience, and help grow the Olympic Movement, the IOC, the Organising Committees for the Olympic and Paralympic Games and our partners use cookies.

Throughout his club career, he played for [Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. "Aston Villa F.C."), [Manchester United](/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C. "Manchester United F.C."), [Blackburn Rovers](/wiki/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C. "Blackburn Rovers F.C."), [Birmingham City](/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C. "Birmingham City F.C."), [Sydney FC](/wiki/Sydney_FC "Sydney FC") and [Sunderland](/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C. "Sunderland A.F.C."), mainly as a [forward](/wiki/Forward_(association_football) "Forward (association football)"), between 1998 and 2009. Yorke formed a prolific strike partnership with [Andy Cole](/wiki/Andy_Cole "Andy Cole") at Manchester United, where he won numerous honours including several [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League "Premier League") titles and the Treble of the Premier League, [FA Cup](/wiki/FA_Cup "FA Cup") and [UEFA Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League "UEFA Champions League") in [1999](/wiki/1998%E2%80%9399_Manchester_United_F.C._season "1998–99 Manchester United F.C. season"). Yorke scored 123 goals in the Premier League, a record for a non-[European](/wiki/Europe "Europe") which was not broken until [Sergio Agüero](/wiki/Sergio_Ag%C3%BCero "Sergio Agüero") in 2017.[[3]](#cite_note-3)\n\nAt international level, Yorke represented [Trinidad and Tobago](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_national_football_team "Trinidad and Tobago national football team") on 74 occasions between 1989 and 2009, scoring 19 goals. He helped his nation reach the semi-finals of the [2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup](/wiki/2000_CONCACAF_Gold_Cup "2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup"), and later qualify for the [FIFA World Cup](/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup") for the first time in its history, representing his country in the [2006 tournament](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup "2006 FIFA World Cup"). After retiring from playing in 2009, Yorke became assistant manager of the Trinidad and Tobago national team, a position he held until the completion of the [qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification "2010 FIFA World Cup qualification").\n\n## Club career\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Club career")]\n\n### Aston Villa\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Aston Villa")]\n\nYorke was first discovered by [Graham Taylor](/wiki/Graham_Taylor "Graham Taylor"), at the time the [Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. "Aston Villa F.C.") manager, on a tour of the West Indies in 1989. Yorke, aged 17, appeared in a team that played a [friendly](/wiki/Friendly_(association_football) "Friendly (association football)") against Aston Villa. Taylor was impressed and offered Yorke a trial at Villa. Yorke was subsequently given a permanent contract and played for the Villa Reserve and Youth sides for the majority of the 1989–90 season, making his [First Division](/wiki/Football_League_First_Division "Football League First Division") debut for Aston Villa against Crystal Palace on 24 March 1990: Crystal Palace won the game 1–0. During his time with Aston Villa, from 1989 to 1998, Yorke played initially as a right winger until the [1995–96 season](/wiki/1995%E2%80%9396_FA_Premier_League "1995–96 FA Premier League"), he then switched to [centre forward](/wiki/Forward_(association_football) "Forward (association football)") and established himself as one of the [Premier League](/wiki/Premier_League "Premier League")\'s top strikers.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nYorke was an integral member of the Villa team that reached the [League Cup](/wiki/EFL_Cup "EFL Cup") Final in 1996. Villa won 3–0 against [Leeds United](/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C. "Leeds United F.C.") with Yorke getting on the scoresheet. On 30 September 1996 he scored a hat-trick against [Newcastle United](/wiki/Newcastle_United "Newcastle United") in a 4–3 defeat. Yorke appeared for Aston Villa on 284 occasions, scoring 97 times.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nThe circumstances of his departure from Aston Villa were controversial. John Gregory, Aston Villa\'s manager at that time, made it known that the club did not want to sell Yorke to Manchester United unless they were prepared to exchange striker [Andy Cole](/wiki/Andy_Cole "Andy Cole"). Yorke played for Villa on the opening day of the season at [Everton](/wiki/Everton_F.C. "Everton F.C.") on 15 August 1998, however it appeared he made little effort during the match as he was unhappy at not being allowed to leave the club. Villa were left with no option but to sell the player and he was transferred to Manchester United for £12.6\xa0million on 20 August 1998.[[4]](#cite_note-4)\n\n### Manchester United\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Manchester United")]\n\nIn his first season Yorke was a key player in guiding his club to a unique treble of the Premier League title, [FA Cup](/wiki/FA_Cup "FA Cup") and [UEFA Champions League](/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League "UEFA Champions League"), and forming a legendary partnership with Andy Cole.[[5]](#cite_note-5) Yorke finished the season as the top league goalscorer with 18 goals and contributed goals against [Bayern Munich](/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich "FC Bayern Munich"), [Barcelona](/wiki/FC_Barcelona "FC Barcelona"), [Inter Milan](/wiki/Inter_Milan "Inter Milan"),[[6]](#cite_note-6) and [Juventus](/wiki/Juventus_FC "Juventus FC") in the Champions League, and he won the [Premier League Player of the Season](/wiki/Premier_League_Player_of_the_Season "Premier League Player of the Season"). Yorke was also a regular member of United\'s [1999–2000](/wiki/1999%E2%80%932000_in_English_football "1999–2000 in English football") title winning team, contributing 23 goals in all competitions.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nDespite a less successful third season, Yorke scored his [100th Premier League goal](/wiki/List_of_footballers_with_100_or_more_Premier_League_goals "List of footballers with 100 or more Premier League goals") in a 3-0 victory over [Derby County](/wiki/Derby_County_F.C. "Derby County F.C.") on 24 November 2000[[7]](#cite_note-7) and also netted a [hat-trick](/wiki/Hat-trick_(association_football) "Hat-trick (association football)") in the top of the table clash with [Arsenal](/wiki/Arsenal_F.C. "Arsenal F.C.").[[8]](#cite_note-8) In January 2002 a move to [Middlesbrough](/wiki/Middlesbrough_F.C. "Middlesbrough F.C.") fell through.[[9]](#cite_note-9) He played his last game for United that month, and was not issued a squad number for the 2002–03 season.[[10]](#cite_note-blackburn-10) Altogether he scored 65 goals for Manchester United in 152 appearances.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n\n### Blackburn Rovers\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Blackburn Rovers")]\n\nIn July 2002, Yorke moved to [Blackburn Rovers](/wiki/Blackburn_Rovers_F.C. "Blackburn Rovers F.C.") for an initial £2\xa0million, potentially rising to £2.6 million; United had wanted a fee of £6 million.[[10]](#cite_note-blackburn-10) He was signed to cover the long absence of [Matt Jansen](/wiki/Matt_Jansen "Matt Jansen") from a traffic accident, and was reunited with his former United strike partner Andy Cole.[[10]](#cite_note-blackburn-10)\n\nYorke scored 13 goals in all competitions in his first season at [Ewood Park](/wiki/Ewood_Park "Ewood Park"), including the winner on 26 October 2002 as Rovers won 2–1 at reigning champions Arsenal.[[12]](#cite_note-12) The following 4 January on his return to [Villa Park](/wiki/Villa_Park "Villa Park"), he scored twice in a 4–1 win in the FA Cup third round.[[13]](#cite_note-13) On 11 May, in the last game of the season, he opened a 4–0 win at [Tottenham Hotspur](/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur "Tottenham Hotspur") as Blackburn beat Everton to sixth place and [UEFA Cup](/wiki/UEFA_Cup "UEFA Cup") qualification.[[14]](#cite_note-14)\n\n### Birmingham City\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Birmingham City")]\n\nOn 31 August 2004, transfer deadline day, Yorke moved to [Birmingham City](/wiki/Birmingham_City_F.C. "Birmingham City F.C.") on a one-year deal with the option of a second. Instead of a loan to [Celtic](/wiki/Celtic_F.C. "Celtic F.C."), he chose to join Birmingham for a "substantial but undisclosed fee".[[15]](#cite_note-15) It was later reported as £250,000.[[16]](#cite_note-released-16)\n\nYorke scored on his home debut for Birmingham in a 1–1 draw against [Charlton Athletic](/wiki/Charlton_Athletic_F.C. "Charlton Athletic F.C."), with the equaliser seven minutes after replacing [Clinton Morrison](/wiki/Clinton_Morrison "Clinton Morrison").[[17]](#cite_note-17) He scored again against Graeme Souness\'s Newcastle on 3 October.[[18]](#cite_note-18) However, Yorke fell out of favour at [St Andrew\'s](/wiki/St_Andrew%27s_(stadium) "St Andrew\'s (stadium)") and was released by mutual consent in April 2005.[[16]](#cite_note-released-16)\n\n### Sydney FC\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Sydney FC")]\n\nYorke immediately signed for [Sydney FC](/wiki/Sydney_FC "Sydney FC"),[[19]](#cite_note-19) with a salary of $1\xa0million a season. He scored the first goal for Sydney FC in its first A-League regular season match, a diving header against the [Melbourne Victory](/wiki/Melbourne_Victory_FC "Melbourne Victory FC"). Yorke came to Sydney FC with the biggest pedigree of all players in the A-League, having won the [treble](/wiki/Treble_(association_football) "Treble (association football)") with Manchester United. Yorke scored 7 goals in the A-League, with three of them being from [penalty kicks](/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football) "Penalty kick (association football)"). Sydney FC coach [Pierre Littbarski](/wiki/Pierre_Littbarski "Pierre Littbarski") moved Yorke into a midfield role and gave him the team captaincy.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nHe played a major role in leading Sydney FC to victory in the inaugural A-League Grand Final on 5 March against regional rivals [Central Coast Mariners](/wiki/Central_Coast_Mariners_FC "Central Coast Mariners FC"). He set up the only goal, scored by [Steve Corica](/wiki/Steve_Corica "Steve Corica"), in front of a sell out crowd of over 41,000 at the [Sydney Football Stadium](/wiki/Sydney_Football_Stadium_(1988) "Sydney Football Stadium (1988)"), and was awarded the [Joe Marston Medal](/wiki/Joe_Marston_Medal "Joe Marston Medal") as best player in the grand final. Yorke was the [marquee player](/wiki/A-League#Marquee_player "A-League") for Sydney FC – meaning that his salary fell outside the salary cap. He was also a star name for the A-League as a whole. Aside from his footballing talents, the drawing power and credibility he brought both locally and internationally proved to be beneficial for the competition in its inaugural season, leading the [Football Federation Australia](/wiki/Football_Federation_Australia "Football Federation Australia") to use his image and name for the promotion of the A-League\'s second season.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nDue to the schedule of football in Australia, Yorke returned to Manchester United for training from March to June 2006, to retain fitness for the World Cup.[[20]](#cite_note-20)\n\nYorke returned to Sydney FC to take part in a friendly against Everton in 2010. The game was considered his \'farewell game\' as he never had the chance to say a proper farewell to the fans at Sydney FC. Everton won the match 1–0, and Yorke was substituted midway through the second half.[[21]](#cite_note-21)\n\n### Sunderland\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Sunderland")]\n\nOn 31 August 2006, Yorke\'s transfer to [Sunderland](/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C. "Sunderland A.F.C.") was announced.[[22]](#cite_note-22) The transfer for a fee of £200,000 ([A$](/wiki/Australian_Dollar "Australian Dollar") $500,000) re-united Yorke with ex-teammate [Roy Keane](/wiki/Roy_Keane "Roy Keane"), manager of Sunderland. Yorke made his debut in the home match against Leicester City and received a rapturous standing ovation from home fans when he came on as a substitute in the first half. Yorke was used as a defensive midfielder rather than his usual striker role.[[23]](#cite_note-23) He scored his first goal for Sunderland in the 2–1 loss against Stoke.\n\nOn 2 January 2008, during Sunderland\'s 1–0 defeat to Blackburn, Yorke was given a red card by referee Rob Styles. Yorke stated several times he would like to return to the [A-League](/wiki/A-League "A-League"), preferably Sydney FC. However, following Sydney FC\'s signings at the time it seemed unlikely that Sydney would have been able to fit him under the salary cap. It was reported that Yorke play for rivals Central Coast Mariners, the team bankrolled by the man who brought him to Sydney, Peter Turnbull.[[24]](#cite_note-24)\n\nOn 11 March 2008, it was announced that the Mariners were in "advanced negotiations" with Yorke to become the marquee for two years.[[25]](#cite_note-25) However, on 1 July he signed a new one-year contract to stay with Sunderland for the 2008–09 season.[[26]](#cite_note-26) He was named [man of the match](/wiki/Man_of_the_match "Man of the match") for his performance[[27]](#cite_note-27) against Arsenal on 4 October 2008, with Sunderland drawing 1–1 at home. Following Keane\'s departure in December 2008, Yorke and [Neil Bailey](/wiki/Neil_Bailey "Neil Bailey") were named as assistants to [Ricky Sbragia](/wiki/Ricky_Sbragia "Ricky Sbragia").[[28]](#cite_note-28) Yorke was released at the end of the 2008–09 season.[[29]](#cite_note-29)\n\n### Post-retirement\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Post-retirement")]\n\nYorke has completed his Level B coaching badge, and in 2010 was quoted as being interested in pursuing a career in coaching, ideally with Aston Villa.[[30]](#cite_note-30) On 17 April 2011 he completed the [London Marathon](/wiki/London_Marathon "London Marathon") in a time of 3 hours and 32 minutes.[[31]](#cite_note-31) On 14 August 2011, Yorke signed a two-year deal to work for [Sky Sports](/wiki/Sky_Sports "Sky Sports") as a pundit.[[32]](#cite_note-32)\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: International career")]\n\nYorke was [capped](/wiki/Cap_(association_football) "Cap (association football)") 72 times for the [Trinidad and Tobago national team](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_national_football_team "Trinidad and Tobago national football team"), scoring 19 goals. Along with his friend [Russell Latapy](/wiki/Russell_Latapy "Russell Latapy"), Yorke was a member of the 1989 \'Strike Squad\', the national team which narrowly failed to qualify for the [1990 FIFA World Cup](/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup "1990 FIFA World Cup").[[33]](#cite_note-33) He retired from international football in 2001 after a disagreement with coach [René Simões](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Sim%C3%B5es "René Simões"), who cut Yorke and [Russell Latapy](/wiki/Russell_Latapy "Russell Latapy") from the squad prior to a decisive game of the [2002 World Cup qualification](/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_%E2%80%93_CONCACAF_final_round "2002 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF final round"), as both missed practice following a night partying.[[34]](#cite_note-34) However he returned to the team for the [2006 World Cup qualification](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification "2006 FIFA World Cup qualification") campaign, in which the team qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time in their history after a 2–1 aggregate qualifying victory over [Bahrain](/wiki/Bahrain_national_football_team "Bahrain national football team").[[35]](#cite_note-35)\n\nYorke was captain for all of Trinidad and Tobago\'s games at the [2006 World Cup](/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup "2006 FIFA World Cup") and was man of the match in the 0–0 draw against [Sweden](/wiki/Sweden_men%27s_national_football_team "Sweden men\'s national football team"), pipping his close friend [Shaka Hislop](/wiki/Shaka_Hislop "Shaka Hislop") to the honour despite the then [West Ham](/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C. "West Ham United F.C.") goalkeeper making several world-class saves. He was one of six players in the Trinidad squad (the others being [Brent Sancho](/wiki/Brent_Sancho "Brent Sancho"), [Dennis Lawrence](/wiki/Dennis_Lawrence "Dennis Lawrence"), [Chris Birchall](/wiki/Chris_Birchall "Chris Birchall"), [Carlos Edwards](/wiki/Carlos_Edwards "Carlos Edwards") and [Stern John](/wiki/Stern_John "Stern John")) to have played every minute of the campaign. Yorke was rated the best defensive midfielder in the opening stages of the World Cup.[[36]](#cite_note-36)\n\nYorke announced his retirement from international football in March 2007, choosing to focus on his club career at Sunderland.[[37]](#cite_note-37) He captained the side in Germany, and up until his retirement. However, he made a guest return appearance for a friendly against [England](/wiki/England_national_football_team "England national football team") in June 2008 after being invited by [FIFA](/wiki/FIFA "FIFA") vice-president Jack Warner.[[38]](#cite_note-38) On 10 July 2008, the [TTFF](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_Football_Federation "Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation") announced Yorke\'s return to the national team for the [2010 World Cup qualification](/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification "2010 FIFA World Cup qualification") campaign.[[39]](#cite_note-39)\n\nOn 15 October 2008, he scored his first international goal after returning from retirement against the [United States](/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team "United States men\'s national soccer team") in a 2010 World Cup qualification match. The game ended 2–1 for Trinidad and Tobago. His goal was a crucial tie-breaker scored in the 79th minute, which put Trinidad and Tobago in a great situation to advance to the next qualifying stage, needing only a tie against Cuba in their final game. On 11 February 2009, Yorke scored a 26th-minute penalty for his country, but was sent off in the dying seconds of Trinidad and Tobago\'s opening match of 2010 World Cup qualification against [El Salvador](/wiki/El_Salvador_national_football_team "El Salvador national football team") (2–2) after exchanging heated remarks with Mexican referee [Marco Antonio Rodríguez](/wiki/Marco_Antonio_Rodr%C3%ADguez "Marco Antonio Rodríguez") (the Trini star had voiced his disapproval of the disruptions caused by the home crowd) and was consequently banned for four games due to his use of abusive language. The suspension was later reduced to two matches.[[40]](#cite_note-40)\n\nAfter being released from Sunderland and being unable to find a club before the end of the current [transfer window](/wiki/Transfer_window "Transfer window"), Yorke retired from football altogether in September 2009, and took up the post of assistant manager with the Trinidad and Tobago national team.[[41]](#cite_note-41)\n\n## Management career\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Management career")]\n\n### Early career\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Early career")]\n\nOn 21 April 2019, Yorke was interviewed for the vacant role at [National League](/wiki/National_League_(division) "National League (division)") side [Sutton United](/wiki/Sutton_United "Sutton United"). However, Sutton appointed [Matt Gray](/wiki/Matt_Gray_(footballer,_born_1981) "Matt Gray (footballer, born 1981)") Instead.[[42]](#cite_note-42)\n\nOn 12 November 2021, [Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C. "Aston Villa F.C.") appointed [Steven Gerrard](/wiki/Steven_Gerrard "Steven Gerrard") as their new manager. Yorke said he was disappointed not to be hired instead.[[43]](#cite_note-43)\n\nOn 21 April 2022 it was reported that Yorke was being considered for the vacant manager\'s position at [Perth Glory](/wiki/Perth_Glory "Perth Glory") in the Australian [A-League Men](/wiki/A-League_Men "A-League Men").[[44]](#cite_note-44)\n\nOn 25 May 2022, Yorke managed the [A-Leagues All Stars](/wiki/A-Leagues_All_Stars_Game "A-Leagues All Stars Game") in their 3–2 loss against [FC Barcelona](/wiki/FC_Barcelona "FC Barcelona").[[45]](#cite_note-45)\n\n### Macarthur FC\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Macarthur FC")]\n\nOn 1 July 2022, Yorke became the new manager of [A-League Men](/wiki/A-League_Men "A-League Men") side [Macarthur FC](/wiki/Macarthur_FC "Macarthur FC"), replacing [Ante Milicic](/wiki/Ante_Milicic "Ante Milicic") to become the club’s second manager.[[46]](#cite_note-46) Three months later, he led the club towards its first trophy after winning the [2022 Australia Cup Final](/wiki/2022_Australia_Cup_Final "2022 Australia Cup Final").\n\nYorke left the Bulls in January 2023, the day after a 1–0 loss to [Adelaide United](/wiki/Adelaide_United_F.C. "Adelaide United F.C.")\n[[47]](#cite_note-47)\n\n### Trinidad and Tobago\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Trinidad and Tobago")]\n\nOn 1 November 2024, Yorke became the new manager of the [Trinidad and Tobago national team](/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_national_football_team "Trinidad and Tobago national football team"), succeeding [Angus Eve](/wiki/Angus_Eve "Angus Eve").[[48]](#cite_note-48)\n\n## Personal life\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Personal life")]\n\nYorke grew up as a [Tottenham Hotspur](/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C. "Tottenham Hotspur F.C.") fan and his first jersey was a white Tottenham Hotspur shirt.[[49]](#cite_note-49)\n\nYorke had a brief relationship with former model turned writer [Katie Price](/wiki/Katie_Price "Katie Price") that produced son Harvey, who was born in May 2002. He is [autistic](/wiki/Autism_spectrum "Autism spectrum") and partially blind, and has the genetic disorder [Prader–Willi syndrome](/wiki/Prader%E2%80%93Willi_syndrome "Prader–Willi syndrome").[[50]](#cite_note-50) In a 2009 interview, Yorke conceded being unfaithful to Price during their relationship, and subsequently playing no role in the upbringing of their son. He has not claimed paternity, despite a paternity test proving he is Harvey\'s father. He has paid no financial amount regarding Harvey\'s care and treatment nor visited or contacted his son.[[51]](#cite_note-51)\n\nThe [Dwight Yorke Stadium](/wiki/Dwight_Yorke_Stadium "Dwight Yorke Stadium") in [Bacolet](/wiki/Bacolet "Bacolet"), Tobago, constructed for the [2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship](/wiki/2001_FIFA_U-17_World_Championship "2001 FIFA U-17 World Championship"), was named in Yorke\'s honour. Yorke is a cricket fan. One of Yorke\'s closest friends is [Brian Lara](/wiki/Brian_Lara "Brian Lara"). During the [1999 Cricket World Cup](/wiki/1999_Cricket_World_Cup "1999 Cricket World Cup"), Yorke made regular appearances bringing on drinks for the [West Indies cricket team](/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team "West Indies cricket team").

The episode involved Yorke coaching the "red team" of contestants while they competed against the "blue team" in a game of football. [Mark Rudan](/wiki/Marko_Rudan "Marko Rudan"), Yorke\'s Sydney FC teammate, was the manager of the "blue team".[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nAs a member of the squad that competed at the 2006 World Cup, Yorke was awarded the [Chaconia Medal (Gold Class)](/wiki/Chaconia_Medal "Chaconia Medal"), the second highest [state decoration](/wiki/Orders,_decorations,_and_medals_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago "Orders, decorations, and medals of Trinidad and Tobago") of Trinidad and Tobago.[[53]](#cite_note-53) He was also made a Sports Ambassador for the country.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]\n\nYorke released his autobiography, *Born to Score*, in 2009.[[54]](#cite_note-54)\n\nIn December 2018, Yorke avoided bankruptcy by paying a £1.5 million debt to [HM Revenue and Customs](/wiki/HM_Revenue_and_Customs "HM Revenue and Customs").[[55]](#cite_note-55)\n\n## Career statistics\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Career statistics")]\n\n### Club\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Dwight_Yorke&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Club")]\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition[[56]](#cite_note-56)\n\n| Club | Season | League | | | National Cup[[a]](#cite_note-57) | | League Cup[[b]](#cite_note-58) | | Continental | | Other | | Total | |\n| Division | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals | Apps | Goals |\n| [Aston Villa](/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.

Coming from a family of nine, Yorke certainly knows about financial hardships — the story of the young Dwight catching crabs in Tobago to buy football boots is a staple of the “rags” part of his story; since his move to Manchester United, the wealthiest club in the world, in August last year, Yorke could quite easily afford to buy boots for the whole island. His generosity is legendary and his mother Grace still receives a portion of his salary every month.\n\nThe other trait that the English fans have learned to love about Yorke is his permanent good nature; his joyful face after each goal shows his pure delight in the game. While many foreign players become unpopular for their arrogance, Yorke still has the humility to admit that “Careers are up and down, people struggle with confidence, you go from one thing to another. It’s the same for everyone, you know? If I hadn’t made it as a footballer, who knows what I’d be doing now!”\n\nSending money home is an important task for Yorke. “Coming from a poor family, that was my number one priority when the money started coming in, to sort things out, especially for my mother. She went through a lot and we’re very close. She’s sorted now — it doesn’t stop her complaining though! But that’s what mums are for, to have a moan at you.”\n\nOld Trafford, the “Theatre of Dreams”, home of Manchester United, has for many years been a graveyard for strikers. Players of the highest regard join the club in the hope of finishing off the numerous chances that others make, only to fail due to weight of expectation. He may have only joined the club last August but already Yorke is exciting the fans as George Best and Bobby Charlton did many years before, and Eric Cantona did more recently. The Tobagonian is fast reaching the peak of his career and is certainly fulfilling his dreams.\n\nLast year the British media raised doubts about the amount of money Yorke was worth when he left Aston Villa, his club of eight years, for Manchester United. Those in the know — such as his adoring fans in Trinidad and Tobago and those more closely involved in his career — knew otherwise. While Villa, who were well aware of their top striker’s talents, were prepared to hold out for more money, they finally agreed to a fee of £12,600,000. In the English game only Alan Shearer had been transferred for more, and that was due to the new-found wealth of his childhood team Newcastle. Now the figure looks a positive bargain as Yorke continues to strike fear into the hearts of Premiership defenders and has developed an awesome partnership with Andy Cole in attack for Manchester United.\n\nIt was Graham Taylor, the former manager of England and no stranger to media attacks, who discovered Yorke on a tour of Trinidad and Tobago with Aston Villa in 1989. Under the tutelage of his mentor, Bertille St Clair, now coach to the national team and a highly regarded figure in the islands, Yorke had postponed his schooling to concentrate on helping Trinidad and Tobago to qualify for the 1990 [World Cup](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/topic_tags/world-cup) finals in Italy. After seeing the young forward in a friendly match, Taylor soon agreed a fee of £120,000 with his club St Clairs, and the 17-year-old was on his way to England.\n\nOne person who was not keen on the transition was his mother. Yorke says, “I had to give up school for eight months in 1989-90 because of the World Cup situation. I was only 17 and she was totally against that. The next thing Villa came on tour and wanted to whizz me away to England. I said to her, ‘I can go back to school when I’m 35 but I can’t play football then.’”\n\nAlthough Trinidad and Tobago narrowly failed to qualify for the World Cup, Yorke and Aston Villa gained from the unlikely meeting. Despite his mother’s initial misgivings, Yorke had seen the success his best friend [Brian Lara](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/topic_tags/brian-lara) had enjoyed in [cricket](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/topic_tags/cricket). “His achievement inspired me. Whatever I do I can’t compete with him because his records are phenomenal, but seeing what he did, and sooner than expected, has spurred me on to be a more recognisable figure in this country as a football player.”\n\nIt wasn’t Yorke’s only offer, though: “I was offered a football scholarship by Harvard University, so if I hadn’t made it in England, I would probably have gone there, although God knows what I would have studied. Accounting probably, I’ve always liked that. I don’t know why, I know it sounds strange. It just appeals to me. Maths was always a favourite of mine at school, figures and that.”\n\nDespite his hopes for a professional career in football, Yorke was extremely modest. “All setbacks do is make you stronger, a little more determined not to let them occur again. What you do is try and pick the positive from that. How can I complain about anything? I haven’t a problem in the world, and you only live this way for so long, certainly in our sport, so you might as well enjoy it. I enjoy every single moment of it.”\n\nIn his first few months at Villa, Yorke came to the attention of David Platt, who went on to captain England. “You could see he had frightening potential, even as a teenager,” recalls Platt. “He used to love doing silly tricks. I remember him standing in a bin so he couldn’t move his feet and controlling the ball with just his head. He would balance it, not on his forehead, but on the top of his head and then he would roll it down his forehead, over his face, kiss it and roll it the way back. How he did it, I still don’t know.”\n\nBecause he was so young, Taylor resisted the temptation of playing Yorke in such a physically demanding league, and he had to wait until his manager left to coach England before making his first appearance for the club. Dr Josef Venglos, the Slovakian coach, eventually gave Yorke his full debut in 1990, ironically against Manchester United, and his performance brought scathing criticism from the former United manager Tommy Docherty. “If that lad makes a First Division footballer, my name is Mao Tse-Tung” were his exact words.\n\nWhile Docherty has not yet changed his name, Yorke has certainly made him eat his words. Subsequently it was Venglos, and not Yorke, who failed in English football, and the next man to take the helm at Villa was the larger-than-life Ron Atkinson, otherwise known as Big Ron. Yorke initially found Atkinson’s style of management not to his liking, but eventually the two wildly different characters reached a compromise. “Ron knows how to get the best out of players, but it was difficult for me at first,” says Yorke. “He winds people up and expects you to have a go back at him. Harsh things were said which I took too personally. I’m a player who needs an arm around me saying, ‘Come on Dwight, you can do it’, and he came to realise that.”\n\nYorke also remembers the time when Villa were on their way to beating Manchester United in the Coca Cola Cup, English football’s most significant tournament after the FA Cup. “We were going down to London and we all went out for a meal to get team spirit going. Ron went on the stage to do karaoke and it was very funny — he did ‘New York, New York, It’s up to you Dwight Yorke’ — and that was really memorable for me.”\n\nVilla also went on to lift the same cup in 1996, but these were the only pieces of silverware he picked up during his time in Birmingham. The game itself was memorable for Yorke. Playing against a Leeds side, managed by Howard Wilkinson, now technical director for the national team, Villa destroyed them 3-0 on a beautiful afternoon at Wembley. The final goal, in the last minute of time, was of course scored by the man himself.\n\nBrian Little was brought in to replace Ron Atkinson. It was not to last, though. After buying Stan Collymore for a club record fee of £7 million, Little had the dilemma of three forwards — Yorke, Savo Milosevic and Collymore — competing for two places. The result was that Yorke was moved back to midfield to accommodate the notoriously erratic Collymore, and Villa spent the majority of last season near the bottom of the table. Little soon resigned and in came Gregory, Yorke’s final Villa manager.\n\nGregory restored Yorke to his favoured position and was rewarded with the goals that not only kept Villa in the Premier League but also qualified them for the UEFA Cup — second in prestige to the European Cup. Gregory made no secret of his admiration for Yorke, his ability at holding the ball up while waiting for team-mates and his knack for conjuring goals from nothing, but the player soon became dissatisfied that summer while watching the 1998 World Cup in France.\n\nThere is no doubt that one of the main reasons for Yorke leaving Villa was to further his ambition. While Villa are a big club by English standards, it became clear that Yorke wanted to test himself at the highest level. Because Manchester United usually finishes the season at the top of the Premier League, the club often qualifies for the European Champions League — the most prestigious tournament in European football and a competition United were desperate to win for only the second time in their history.\n\nYorke was enthralled by Champions League football: “It’s the best thing ever, man; it’s fantastic, home or away. Provided the manager picks me! That’s why I came to this club. To prove to people, and myself, that I could compete with the best in the world. I’m unlikely to play in a World Cup with Trinidad and Tobago, so playing for United in the Champions League is my World Cup. Playing for Manchester United gives me the opportunity to play alongside — and against — the very best players around. For instance, I played against Lothar Matthaus the other day. There were times I never dreamed I’d share the same pitch with someone like that.”\n\nIt was during and after World Cup 1998 in France that United manager Alex Ferguson set his sights on a forward of the highest pedigree. The legendary Argentinian forward Gabriel Batistuta and Patrick Kluivert of Holland were both candidates. When Batistuta decided to stay in Italy with Fiorentina and Kluivert opted for Barcelona, Ferguson set his sights on Yorke. Yorke’s manager John Gregory, however, was not interested in the least, and so began the long process of securing Yorke’s release from Villa. Gregory had only taken over at Villa Park a few months before, and having guided the club away from relegation — greatly helped by Yorke, who scored seven goals in seven games towards the end of the season — was desperate not to lose one of his finest players to the biggest club in the land.\n\nBut he was up against Ferguson, one of the shrewdest characters in the game. After the rumours started, Gregory dismissed them as “scurrilous” and said: “There’s no way he’s going anywhere, so the fans should not worry.” Yorke, though, had other thoughts on the matter, and soon the drama was heightened when both Yorke and United wanted to complete the deal as quickly as possible so that he would be eligible for the Champions League.\n\nRisking the wrath of the Villa fans, Yorke issued a statement; “It would be fair to say I still want to go to Manchester United. I have always said the Champions League is the type of stage I want. I spent all summer watching the World Cup, knowing I will never get there with Trinidad and Tobago. That is why I need to play at the highest club level I can. There is no point moving just to play in the Premiership. I can stay here and do that. Opportunities like this only come along once in a lifetime, and I had asked John Gregory and the Villa board for their understanding. I don’t want Villa fans to see me as disloyal. I would ask every supporter to think what they would do if they were offered another job which they would really like to do.”\n\nDespite his best friend Brian Lara’s advice to stay with Villa, Yorke had set his mind on the move. “Many people have warned me about the pressures of playing for United, especially as a striker. Brian, for instance, said I did not need to move to Manchester United to realise my dreams, but this was a call I had to answer. It has been a long, long journey and I do not intend to fail now.”\n\nAfter a long dispute, Villa finally backed down. At the time the Villa chairman, Doug Ellis, commented, “I know Dwight very well and it became obvious to me that while we could keep him physically, we had lost him mentally.” Gregory was not so gracious in defeat. “I never wanted to sell him and if I’d had a gun I’d have shot him.\n\nAnd so, finally, Yorke was allowed to join Manchester United for a fee of £12,600,000. Yorke joined other new signings Jaap Stam and the Swedish winger Jesper Blomqvist in a formidable squad already boasting the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Roy Keane.\n\nIn the past, strikers have struggled to live with the responsibility of playing for United. The atmosphere at Old Trafford often gets the better of players who have arrived for vast transfer sums, and, as a result, their form suffers. No such problems for the supremely confident Yorke, who took to the club like a duck to water. He made his debut for United in the intimidating atmosphere of West Ham, in London’s East End. Although he failed to score in a drab goalless draw, he did manage two in his next league game for the club, a 4-1 win over Charlton United. Manager Alex Ferguson, renowned for his knack of bringing out the best in players, said at the time, “There are so many different facets to him. He is brave, he has stamina, he can play with both feet and he can beat men. When you add all the parts up, you know he is a very special player. The complete centre-forward.”\n\nIt hasn’t been all work and no play for Yorke; his career as a “single man” has sometimes threatened to overshadow his exploits on the field. During his time in the English Midlands, Yorke was so well-loved that he became known as the “King of Birmingham”. He was often seen in the city’s nightclubs and certainly knew how to enjoy himself. A string of women sold their stories to national newspapers, recounting tales of passion with the young, strongly-built footballer. Yorke, though, was, of course, not married, and despite the media interest in his private life, there were rarely stories of a critical nature.\n\nHis performances for United in the Champions League have been nothing short of devastating. In qualifying for the Quarter-Finals — no mean feat — United scored a record number of goals, including six past the mighty Spanish champions Barcelona over two games. Yorke had certainly arrived. His partnership with Andy Cole is undoubtedly the finest in the country, made all the more surprising by Cole’s previous difficulties.\n\nThe transformation of Cole since Yorke’s arrival has been staggering. Good friends on and off the pitch, they have both been scoring for fun in recent months. “Andy and I bond together both on and off the field, which I think is rare. It’s why we’re doing so well as a pairing. He’s taken personal time out to show me around Manchester, the shops, where to go. I got lost the first time I tried to find The Cliff (United’s training ground). I had to phone Andy to find out how to get there. Even when everyone was saying I was a threat to his place in the team, he was inviting me to his home and family and feeding me there — which helps when you are stuck in a hotel. If it wasn’t for Andy I’d have been in that room pulling my hair out, not that I’ve got much, but I would have been. There’s only so much you can do in a hotel room.”\n\nNo such problem now for Yorke, who has just bought his own impressive house in Manchester. It’s a long way from the islands of the Caribbean, but, at least for the time being, it’s home.\n\n[←](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-37/andy-narrell-caribbean-man)[![Image 33: At home in the U.S. Photograph by Michael Goodwin](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/046_musicbeat_37-260x260.jpg)](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-37/andy-narrell-caribbean-man)[Previous Story Andy Narrell: Caribbean Man](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-37/andy-narrell-caribbean-man)\n\n[→](https://www.caribbean-beat.com/issue-37/barbados-kids)[![Image 34: From Signal station to beach to nature reserve, Barbados is educational and fun for children.

Dwight Yorke will hope that this ability to hit the target will transition over to the golf course at the ICONS of Football 2017 tournament this summer, so he and his Rest of the World teammates will smile all the way to victory.\n\nYorke was first discovered by Graham Taylor, the then manager of Aston Villa, who was impressed enough to eventually offer the Trinidad and Tobago International a permanent contract.\n\nYorke was initially a right winger before making the swap to centre forward where he produced at an elite level. During his time with Aston Villa, Yorke was a crucial part of the club that reached the League Cup Final defeating Leeds United 3-0 in 1996, where he scored in the 88th minute.\n\nYorke appeared in 196 matches for the Villans, netting 63 goals for the club. Yorke’s high quality of play at Villa drew the attention of Man United leading him to eventually make the switch to Old Trafford. Yorke was transferred to Man United at the start of the 1998-99 season ending the nine years he spent at Aston Villa.\n\nThe former Aston Villa star found great success at Manchester United both at an individual level and on the club level. In his first season with the club, they won the unique treble of the Premiership Title, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. The Trinidad and Tobago star was a vital centrepiece in their \xa0Champions League run scoring goals against Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Internazionale and Juventus.\n\nYorke finished with a League-high 18 goals that campaign and was named the Premier League Player of the Season. While at United, Yorke paired with Andy Cole to become one of the most legendary striking duos in the Premier League and one of the most feared attacking partnerships in Europe. The two were part of a Man United club that won three consecutive Premier League Titles.\n\nIt was on this day in 2001 that Yorke had the highest scoring match of his career with three goals and an assist against Arsenal.\n\nIn addition to having a very successful club career, the star striker also was an important contributor to the Trinidad and Tobago national club making 72 caps for his home nation. Yorke was a key member of the 2006 team that qualified for the World Cup – the first time a Trinidad squad had qualified for a World Cup in the country’s history. He was one of six members of the team that played every minute of the campaign. As a result of his storied career, Yorke was the first Tobagonian to be inducted into T&T Sports Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nAfter his time at Manchester United, the goal scoring machine spent two seasons at Blackburn Rover rejoining Andy Cole, his fellow striker at Man United that he found so much success with earlier in their careers. In his first season with the club Yorke netted 13 goals and helped the club qualify for the UEFA Cup. Yorke represented five different Premier League clubs over his storied career and also had a stint in Australia’s A league with Sydney F.C.\n\nYorke will be remembered as one of the greatest strikers the Premier League has seen and was part of an all time great Man United team of the late 90’s and early 2000’s. The Trinidad and Tobago star forward had 123 goals in his 375 caps in Premier League play, Yorke was the first non English player to score 100 goals in the Premiership.\n\nWhat is even more remarkable is that, despite being known as one of the deadliest and unforgiving strikers of the modern era, Yorke was always seen to be sporting his trademark grin, seemingly wider than any goal he would shoot the ball into. It was this look that made him as endearing to fans, not just of his clubs, but of football. A player who found infectious joy every time he laced up his boots.\n\nAs the Rest of the World team prepares to take on the England team in the ICONS of Football 2017 tournament this June, Dwight Yorke will be counted on to help get the win for the ROTW team at The Belfry. One thing is guaranteed – whether he’s on the fairway or in the changing room, Yorke will be wearing a smile that will light up the event.\n\n![Soca Warriors Online](/images/logos/site/logo_socawarriors_net_01.png)\n\n### Social', 'images': []}
