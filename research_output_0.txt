2022 World Cup\n\n18 December 2022\n\nShare this quote\n\nShare\n\n##### Players recognised with individual awards at 2022 World Cup\n\n18 December 2022\n\n{0} min. reading time\n\n* **Argentina won third World Cup after penalty shoot-out victory against France**\n* **Young Player, Golden Glove, Golden Boot, and Golden Ball awards presented after final**\n* **FIFPRO recaps the winners of the Qatar 2022 player awards**\n\nAfter Argentina claimed their third men’s World Cup crown following a penalty shoot-out victory against France, four players were recognised for their outstanding performances with individual awards.\n\nThe Young Player, Golden Glove, Golden Boot, and Golden Ball awards were all presented before *La Albiceleste* lifted the men’s World Cup trophy –\xa0which closed the curtain on four thrilling weeks of international football. FIFPRO recaps the winners of the player awards at Qatar 2022.\n\n### **Young Player Award: Enzo Fernandez**\n\n**Age**: 21**Position**: Midfielder**Club**: Benfica **Nation**: Argentina\n\nEnzo Fernandez was crowned the best young player at Qatar 2022. The 21-year-old, who only made his senior debut for Argentina in September 2022, played in all of his country’s seven games at the tournament.\n\nThe midfielder saw off stern competition from the likes of team-mate Julian Alvarez, England’s Jude Bellingham, Portugal’s Goncalo Ramos, and France’s Aurelien Tchouameni to claim the award.\n\n#### **What they said**\n\n"I know Enzo very well, here from the national team and I also played against him in the Champions League. He deserves it, because he’s a spectacular kid and a very important player for us." – Lionel Messi on Enzo Fernandez.\n\n### **Golden Glove Award: Emiliano Martinez**\n\n**Age**: 30**Position**: Goalkeeper**Club**: Aston Villa**Nation**: Argentina\n\nAfter helping Argentina to a Copa America triumph last year, Emiliano Martinez went one further by adding a global title to his list of international trophies. The stopper kept three clean sheets at Qatar 2022, as well as coming out victorious in two shoot-outs.\n\nMartinez played every minute of Argentina’s campaign and saved Kingsley Coman\'s spot-kick in the final shoot-out.\n\n#### **What they said**\n\n"The World Cup is something I have been dreaming of. I have no words to express what I\'m feeling." – Emiliano Martinez.\n\n### **Golden Boot Award: Kylian Mbappe**\n\n**Age**: 23**Position**: Forward**Club**: Paris Saint-Germain**Nation**: France\n\nKylian Mbappe took home the Golden Boot Award after finishing top scorer with eight goals. Mbappe made history by becoming just the second man to net a World Cup final hat-trick, after England’s Geoff Hurst in 1966. With four goals across 2018 and 2022, the talisman has also established himself as the highest-scoring player in World Cup final history.\n\nMbappe is a two-time FIFA FIFPRO Men’s World 11 winner, having been named in the 2018 and 2019 teams.\n\n### **Golden Ball Award: Lionel Messi**\n\n**Age**: 35**Position**: Forward**Club**: Paris Saint-Germain**Nation**: Argentina\n\nLionel Messi made history by becoming the first man to win the World Cup Golden Ball twice. After first claiming the award for the World Cup’s best player at Brazil 2014, Messi picked up the Qatar 2022 gong after providing seven goals and three assists – and helping Argentina win the trophy for the first time in 32 years. Mbappe and Luka Modric received the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball respectively.\n\nMessi, who has been named in 15 successive FIFA FIFPRO Men’s World 11s, netted his 97th and 98th goals for Argentina in the final.\n\n#### **What they said**\n\n"Messi should have a place in the next World Cup. If he wants to continue playing, the \'10\' will always be his." – Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni.\n\n[News\n\n### Five-star Guardado, Messi and Ronaldo make men\'s World Cup history](/en/supporting-players/player-influence/player-impact/five-star-guardado-messi-and-ronaldo-make-men-s-world-cup-history)\n\n[### FIFPRO launches series for professional footballers to talk about social topics](/en/supporting-players/player-influence/shine-a-light/fifpro-launches-series-for-professional-footballers-to-talk-about-social-topics)\n\n[Statement\n\n### FIFPRO Statement: International Match Calendar](/en/supporting-players/competitions-innovation-and-growth/competition-design-and-structures/fifpro-statement-international-match-calendar-men-and-women)\n\n ', 'images': []}, {'url': 'https://www.pff.com/news/world-cup-2022-the-50-best-players-of-the-world-cup-including-kylian-mbappe-lionel-messi-achraf-hakimi', 'raw_content': "[All  - current](/news)\n\n[NFL Draft](/draft)\n\n# FIFA World Cup 2022: The 50 best players of the World Cup, including Kylian Mbappé, Lionel Messi, Achraf Hakimi and more\n\nBy PFF.com\n\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup is in the books, and it marks the first major international tournament that PFF has fully graded.\n\nHarking back to PFF's early days, our staff sat down to dig into the grades and metrics to come up with a list of the top 50 players at the tournament. Here’s what they decided.\n\n### **1. Lionel Messi, Argentina**\n\nTo no surprise, the G.O.A.T. tops our list.\n\nThe Argentinian legend earned the highest dribbling grade (95.0) and completed the most dribbles (26) at the tournament, and his 60.5% completion rate was the highest among players who attempted at least 20 dribbles.\n\nThe PSG forward also earned a 90.4 passing grade, fifth among players in Qatar, while his 43 line-breaking passes finished ninth. His seven goals and three assists were just the cherry on top of an all-time tournament performance.\n\n### **2. Antoine Griezmann, France**\n\nGriezmann may not have had his best game in the final, but that should not overshadow his incredible tournament. He finished with a PFF crossing grade of 84.3, fourth among players with 10 cross attempts, while his 87.6 passing grade was also one of the World Cup's best marks. He left Qatar having created 22 chances, the second-most among all players.\n\n### **3. Achraf Hakimi, Morocco**\n\nThe PSG man finished with seven grades over 70.0, the most by any player. Chief among those were his 79.6 aerial-duel grade, his 80.1 50/50 grade and his 77.8 challenge grade.\n\nHakimi won 44 challenges in all, third at the World Cup, and led the tournament in dribbles defended with 13.\n\n### **4. Kylian Mbappé, France**\n\nThe Golden Boot winner comes in at No. 4 after scoring eight goals and accumulating two assists. Mbappé was held in check in both the quarterfinal and semifinal, as he generated only 0.03 expected goals (xG) against England and 0.33 xG against Morocco.\n\nThe French superstar did finish with a shooting grade of 86.5, good for seventh-best among players who took at least five shots. He was also a menace in possession, leading all players with 34 possessions in the opposition's box.\n\n### **5. Jude Bellingham, England**\n\nThe English wunderkind had an excellent tournament, only confirming rumors that he will be the hottest name heading into the winter transfer window.\n\nBellingham finished with three goals, one assist and four key passes, ultimately producing a 91.8 shooting grade, 76.7 passing grade and a 92.1 challenge grade.\n\nBellingham defended 70% of the dribbles against him, first among players who defended at least 10 dribbles. He also completed 89.8% of his passes, 10th among center midfielders.\n\n### **6. Theo Hernandez, France**\n\nAfter his brother Lucas was ruled out of the World Cup with an injury in France’s first match, Theo Hernandez stepped up big for Les Bleus. His 90.5 crossing grade led all full-backs and ranked second among all players in the World Cup. He also put up a 79.4 50/50 grade, a 78.9 challenge grade and an 80.1 defending-dribbles grade.\n\nThe AC Milan defender was also key in France’s attack, creating 11 chances (first among full-backs) and scoring the important opening goal in the semifinal against Morocco.\n\n### **7. Luka Modric, Croatia**\n\nThe 37-year-old Croatian legend was once again world-class in what was possibly his last World Cup. The Real Madrid maestro dominated the competition with a 91.9 passing grade and a tournament-leading leading 58 completed line-breaking passes.\n\nAlthough he couldn’t achieve the goal of winning it all, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner will still be remembered as the key player who helped Croatia win back-to-back World Cup medals.\n\n### **8. Casemiro, Brazil**\n\nDespite Brazil’s shockingly early exit from the World Cup, Casemiro had a spectacular tournament. The five-time UEFA Champions League winner orchestrated Brazil’s attack, producing an 88.0 PFF passing grade, a top-10 mark, to go with an 81.7 shooting grade.\n\nHe was also a defensive force in the midfield, leading the Brazilian side with nine blocks and winning 14 of the 15 50/50 duels he faced. In the end, he earned an 87.1 PFF grade for 50/50 duels, the fifth-best mark at the tournament.\n\n### **9. Josko Gvardiol, Croatia**\n\nOnly 20 years old, Gvardiol shined bright in his first World Cup, attracting top clubs around the world. He led all center-backs with an 88.4 grade for 50/50 duels and was a huge defensive presence, earning 70.0-plus PFF grades for challenges (75.1), defending dribbles (77.9) and tackles (71.8).\n\nHis versatility was also on display, as he completed 53 line-breaking passes, the third-most at the tournament, and all five of his dribble attempts to lead all center-backs.\n\n### **10. Mateo Kovacic, Croatia**\n\nIn addition to Croatia’s third-place finish, the Chelsea midfielder should be proud of his overall performance. He boasts three top-three PFF grades, having put up the tournament's second-best dribbling grade (93.5) and tournament-leading marks in challenge grade (94.3) and tackling grade (96.9).\n\nOn top of that, he created nine chances, second among his Croatian teammates, and applied a tournament-leading 329 pressures.\n\n### **11. Aurélien Tchouaméni, France**\n\nTchouaméni anchored the French midfield throughout the tournament, impressing in a number of games. He did miss a penalty in the World Cup final shootout, but that shouldn’t overshadow his performance. He excelled defensively, posting the highest 50/50 grade among all players (93.1) and the third-best grade among midfielders for aerial duels (90.1).\n\n### **12. Bruno Fernandes, Portugal**\n\nIt was a disappointing World Cup for Portugal, but Fernandes excelled. He was a constant threat, ultimately earning a 91.7 passing grade, and he led the tournament with eight defensive-line-breaking passes. The Manchester United midfielder also chipped in with two goals and three assists in his four games as one of the focal points of Portugal’s attack.\n\n### **13. Vinícius Junior, Brazil**\n\nThe Real Madrid star furthered his reputation as one of the most exciting players in football during his first World Cup. With six PFF grades above 70.0, he ranked above average in pretty much every category across the tournament. He produced two assists and seven key passes, contributing to his 77.5 passing grade. His best game came against South Korea in the Round of 16 when he scored and picked up one of his assists.\n\n### **14. Sofiane Boufal, Morocco**\n\nNow plying his trade in Ligue 1 with Angers, the former Southampton winger was a key part of Morocco’s history-making side. He earned a 91.0 dribbling grade over the tournament, second among players at his position. He produced a 91.5 dribbling grade in the Round of 16 against Spain alone, the second-highest single-game dribbling grade of the tournament.\n\n### **15. Julian Alvarez, Argentina**\n\nAnother player who feels like he’s announced himself as a star over the last month, Alvarez was crucial to Argentina’s World Cup win. Not even the first choice to lead the line when the tournament started, Alvarez had made the position his own by the end of the group stages. He was direct and exciting throughout the knockout stages, exemplified by his four goals and 85.5 shooting grade.\n\n### **16. Olivier Giroud, France**\n\nGiroud did not have a World Cup final to remember, but we mustn't forget the role the striker played in getting France to that point. He scored four goals to become France’s all-time leading goal scorer and was the World Cup's highest-graded player for aerial duels (94.8).\n\n### **17. Emiliano Martínez, Argentina**\n\nMartinez’s heroics in the final secured the Golden Glove Award and a No. 1 spot on [PFF's list of top goalkeepers](https://www.pff.com/news/world-cup-2022-the-5-best-goalkeepers-at-the-2022-world-cup). The quality of his shot-stopping shone through in our metrics, with Martinez boasting the tournament’s second-highest shot-stopping grade at 88.0. His positioning was also superb, as he received zero downgrades for positioning through seven matches.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Martinez’s highest-graded save was that 123rd-minute denial of Kolo Muani, which gave Argentina the opportunity to win the World Cup final on penalties. Talk about delivering when it matters most.\n\n### **18. Nayef Aguerd, Morocco**\n\nMorocco did not concede a goal to an opposition player until the semifinal, and much of this defensive success is down Aguerd. He earned the highest challenge grade (86.2) of all center-backs at this World Cup and was 100% successful on his 50/50s (2-of-2) and dribbles faced (4-of-4). On top of that, he also produced the highest clearance grade (90.4) of all center-backs.\n\n### **19. Frenkie de Jong, Netherlands**\n\nAn all-around midfielder, De Jong contributed in various ways at this World Cup. He led the Dutch side in passes completed (366), including the fifth-most line-breaking passes at the tournament (51). He was also a force in the air and put up the tournament's second-highest aerial-duel grade (93.5), behind only Oliver Giroud. He also chipped in with a goal and an assist before their quarterfinal exit to Argentina.\n\n### **20. Pedri, Spain**\n\nThe Barcelona midfielder earned a 92.1 passing grade for the tournament and was near the top of nearly every passing metric. He completed 395 passes, 13th among all players, including 52 line-breaking passes (4th), five defensive-line-breaking passes (3rd) and six chances created (37th). He was also combative when required, winning five of the seven 50/50 challenges he was involved in.\n\n### **21. Joshua Kimmich, Germany**\n\nKimmich’s 91.8 passing grade ranked third overall among all players, but that wasn’t the only area in which the playmaker excelled. As the main outlet for Germany, receiving more targets than any other teammate, he complemented his 91% pass completion rate with a 79.8 shooting grade and a 72.9 crossing grade, top-10 among central midfielders.\n\n### **22. Richarlison, Brazil**\n\nRicharlison led the line brilliantly for Brazil throughout the tournament to finish as the country’s top scorer with three goals in four matches. His shooting prowess earned a 92.4 grade, behind only Cameroon’s Vincent Aboubakar and South Korea’s Hee-chan Hwang among fellow strikers. While neither of that duo makes this list, Richarlison does for his work off-the-ball, as he recorded the most pressure attempts for Brazil (129) and won more 50/50 duels than he lost to grade out at 82.2 in that facet.\n\n### **23. Tyler Adams, United States**\n\nAnnounced as USMNT captain for the World Cup despite being only 23, Adams led by example to help his team reach the Round of 16 with a crucial performance against Iran. The midfielder starred in the winner-takes-all clash with an 89.0 passing grade and a team-leading challenge grade of 81.1.\n\n### **24. Alexis Mac Allister, Argentina**\n\nMac Allister sent Argentina on their way to a dominant first half in the final against France, starting the move that saw him provide the assist for Angel Di Maria to make it 2-0. Across the whole tournament, Mac Allister was solid in defensive duties for the champions, posting an 87.6 challenge grade while receiving only three positioning downgrades over his eight matches. If not for his 58.7 passing grade, the Argentine would be much higher on this list.\n\n### **25. Adrien Rabiot, France**\n\nAmong all players at the World Cup to be involved in more than 70 challenges, only Croatia’s Dejan Lovren fared better than France anchorman Adrien Rabiot, with the latter’s 7.2 challenges won per 90 minutes narrowly outdone by Lovren’s 7.4. Together with Aurélien Tchouaméni, Rabiot formed a formidable midfield partnership en route to earning a 90.8 aerial duel grade and an 86.0 grade on 50-50s.\n\n### **26. Éder Militão, Brazil**\n\nMilitão was the strongest performer in the Brazil back line in the tournament, particularly when involved in 50-50 duels, He won 80% of those he was involved in and earned an 84.3 50-50 duel grade to rank 15th best among all players to contest at least five 50-50 duels and fourth among all defenders. He was also reliable in the air, winning 61% of his aerial duels to reach a 77.1 grade on such instances.\n\n### **27. Wojciech Szczęsny, Poland**\n\nJuventus' Szczęsny is the second-ranked keeper on this list. Poland’s No. 1 faced the most shots on target, 27, and saved the most, 22, of any keeper throughout the tournament, despite playing in only four games. His strong performance between the posts earned him an 85.1 shot-stopping grade, the fourth-best mark at the position. An additional feather in his cap was the fact he was the only keeper to save a penalty from Lionel Messi.\n\n### **28. Cody Gakpo, Netherlands**\n\nGakpo scored in all three of the group games despite managing just three shots on target. Although he didn’t get on the scoresheet in the knockout rounds, he finished with an 81.3 shooting grade with a 100% success rate from his shots on target. And despite not coming away with any assists in the tournament, Gakpo did have the most passes of any Netherlands player that created chances for his teammates (11).\n\n### **29. Ousmane Dembélé, France**\n\nIt was a World Cup final to forget for Dembélé, who gave away an early penalty and was substituted out before halftime. However, the rest of his tournament wasn’t so lamentable. The winger ended with the 15th-best crossing grade for all players (79.4) and the 19th-best passing grade (83.6). He created 13 chances in total and finished with two assists, both of which rank second for France, behind only Antoine Griezmann.\xa0\xa0\n\n### **30. Virgil van Dijk, Netherlands**\n\nThe lasting memory of van Dijk in this World Cup will likely be his missed penalty at the start of the quarter-final shootout defeat to Argentina. Prior to that, however, the Liverpool defender had earned the fourth-best passing grade of all center-backs (84.6) with the third-most line-breaking passes of any player for the Netherlands. He was also strong in 50-50 duels, winning 80% of those he contested to earn a 78.3 50-50 grade.\n\n### **31. Raphaël Guerreiro, Portugal**\n\nGuerreiro was one of the standout full-backs at the tournament and one of Portugal's key creative threats. His 81.9 crossing grade ranked third at the position and 12th among all players. The Borussia Dortmund man also showcased the passing ability that has allowed him to play in central midfield in the past, registering an 81.8 passing grade, creating four chances and averaging 4.3 completed line-breaking passes per 90 minutes (10th for full-backs, minimum 100 passes).\n\n### **32. Harry Souttar, Australia**\n\nSouttar excelled at the back for Australia and was a key part of a side that ran eventual winners Argentina close in the Round of 16. He led all center-backs with an 89.0 aerial duel grade and won 71% of his aerial challenges. He also won 66% of the challenges he was involved in, leading the team (minimum five challenges), and recorded an 80.3 grade in a tournament performance befitting a Stoke City defender.\n\n### **33. Mohammed Kudus, Ghana**\n\nWhile it was ultimately a disappointing World Cup for Ghana, Kudus can be pleased with his performance, particularly in the win over South Korea when he scored twice. His 83.0 shooting grade and four shots on target both led the team in an impressive tournament that may well put yet another Ajax player on the radar of bigger clubs. Kudus also performed well in 50-50 duels, winning 60% of them for an 82.0 grade.\n\n### **34. Yassine Bounou, Morocco**\n\nThe tale of Morocco’s historic run to the semifinals can’t be told without a mention of Bounou’s fantastic performances, especially his three penalty shootout saves in the Round of 16 against Spain. He saved 58.3% of his shots faced, with two of the five goals he conceded deemed unsavable, and recorded an 85.8 shot-stopping grade, which ranked third for goalkeepers. Bounou also won all four of his aerial duels for a 73.6 grade, which ranked second among goalkeepers.\n\n### **35. Jamal Musiala, Germany**\n\nGermany underperformed at the World Cup, but Musiala at least provided a bright spot. The Bayern Munich player was the third-best dribbler at the tournament by our metrics, boasting a 91.3 grade. Despite playing in only three games, he attempted the fourth-most dribbles of any player. And he still managed to complete 56.67% of them, good for 19th overall (minimum 10 dribbles). Musiala also recorded a 73.1 aerial duel grade that ranked sixth for attacking midfielders.\n\n### **36. Diogo Dalot, Portugal**\n\nAs a full-back more renowned for his attacking talents, Dalot used the 2022 World Cup to showcase his defensive abilities. Dalot was the No. 1-ranked full-back with an 87.6 challenge grade, winning eight of his 11 aerial duels and one of his two 50-50 challenges. He tops all players in the tournament with a 92.9 grade defending against the dribble, winning 80% of the dribbles attempted against him.\xa0\n\n### **37. Luis Chávez, Mexico**\n\nChávez had a monstrous tournament in Qatar, leading El Tri in several of our key facets. Chávez finished with an 81.3 passing grade for the tournament, ranking 10th among all central midfielders. Chávez also leaves Qatar with a 78.5 crossing grade, third at the position. Perhaps most impressively, his 93.2 shooting grade led the position and he finished third overall when striking the ball this tournament.\xa0\n\n### **38. Granit Xhaka, Switzerland**\n\nXhaka continued his renaissance of good form this season in the Premier League into Qatar, where he finished fifth among all players with an 88.1 passing grade on 88% pass completion. Xhaka led all Swiss players with his 76.0 challenge grade and ranked fourth among all central midfielders with an 86.5 aerial duel grade, winning nine of his 14 duels in the air.\n\n### **39. Enner Valencia, Ecuador**\n\nThrough the opening two fixtures, Valencia was the leading goal scorer of the tournament. An unfortunate knee injury prevented him from finishing the match against the Dutch, though, and he certainly wasn’t at 100% in Ecuador's pivotal final match against Senegal. Still, Valencia managed to finish as the fourth-highest-graded shooter, with a 93.1 shooting grade. Valencia also led all Ecuadorians with 11 possessions in the opponent's penalty area.\n\n### **40. Dominik Livaković, Croatia**\n\nLivaković was a rock for the third-place Croatian side in this tournament, facing more shots (78) than any other goalkeeper in the competition. Livaković had numerous highlights throughout the tournament, securing a clean sheet against both Morocco and Belgium in the group stage. He came up huge in both penalty shootouts Croatia participated in, with an incredible three saves in the shootout against Japan in the Round of 16, followed by another penalty save in their upset against tournament favorites Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\n### **41. Enzo Fernández, Argentina**\n\nHaving earned the Best Young Player award at the World Cup, Fernández was a live wire in the heart of the Argentinian midfield, completing 87.9% of the passes he attempted. His 77.8 challenge grade for the tournament showed the other side of his game, too. The cherry on the cake of his performances was a wonder goal against Mexico.\n\n### **42. Azzedine Ounahi, Morocco**\n\nAnother young gem of this edition of the World cup, Ounahi was an integral part of Morocco's dream run to the semi-finals. He produced an 87.7 PFF dribbling grade, ranking second among central midfielders. He impressed as a passer, too, with his 35 line-breaking passes ranking 13th at the position.\n\n### **43. Dani Olmo, Spain**\n\nOlmo led all players with a 94.2 PFF crossing grade from 14 crosses at the tournament. He scored Spain’s opening goal of the tournament and finished with a 79.1 PFF shooting grade. Olmo completed 84.8% of his passes at the tournament, including six line-breaking passes.\n\n### **44. Silvan Widmer, Switzerland**\n\nWidmer impressed going forward and creating for Switzerland at the tournament, producing an 82.9 PFF crossing grade that ranked second among all full-backs, behind only France’s Theo Hernández. He defended well, too, as shown by his 84.8 PFF 50-50 duel grade and 85.5 PFF defending dribbles grade.\n\n### **45. Harry Maguire, England**\n\nConstantly under the microscope for his performances at the club level, Maguire was included in England’s World Cup team and rightly proved the critics wrong. Always an aerial threat offensively, Maguire was a sentinel in defense for England. An 86.1 tackling grade (third) and 83.5 challenge grade (seventh) make a case for him as one of the center-backs of the tournament. He was unlucky on a couple of occasions when his powerful headers hit the crossbar and deprived him of goals to add to his outstanding defensive feats.\n\n### **46. Ismail Jakobs, Senegal**\n\nJakobs' 93.3 PFF aerial duel grade was the third best of any player at the tournament, while his 81.7 PFF tackling grade ranked 29th. He won 81.8% of the 22 aerial duels he was involved in and successfully completed a tackle on four of eight attempts. He also successfully defended three of the five dribbles he faced and won four of the six 50-50 duels he was involved in.\n\n### **47. Jordan Pickford, England**\n\nPickford stood out between the sticks for England with consistently impressive performances. His 93.3 shot-stopping grade was the best of any goalkeeper at the tournament, while his 75.6 passing grade ranked second at the position to only Switzerland’s Yann Sommer.\n\n### **48. Kim Young-gwon, South Korea**\n\nKim was tremendously consistent for South Korea at the tournament, putting forth a strong performance in a number of facets. He finished with 70.0-plus PFF grades in passing (77.7), aerial duels (82.0), challenges (71.5) and clearances (76.0).\n\n### **49. Ritsu Doan, Japan**\n\nDoan was one of the top crossers of the ball at the tournament, with his 83.9 PFF crossing grade the third best among all players who attempted at least 10 crosses at the tournament. He also impressed on 50-50 duels, winning four of the seven he attempted to earn an 83.2 50-50 duel grade — 19th best among all players to contest at least five 50-50 duels throughout the competition.\xa0\n\n### **50. Neymar, Brazil**\n\nDespite playing in just three games at the tournament after missing Brazil's second and third group stage contests through injury, Neymar was still a key player at the tournament, ranking tied for 28th with 28 line-breaking passes received throughout the World Cup. He was tied for the sixth-most dribbles attempted (27) and tied for the seventh-most dribbles completed (14) at the tournament despite the limited playing time.\n\nAll Featured Tools\n\n* [PFF Player Prop Tool (New!)](https://www.pff.com/betting/player-props)\n* [Key Insights](https://www.pff.com/betting/key-insights)\n\n  AI-powered football analysis for winning decisions\n\n  Available with\n* [NFL Matchups](https://www.pff.com/tools/matchups)\n* [Player Grades](https://www.pff.com/nfl/grades/position/qb)\n* [Fantasy League Sync](https://www.pff.com/fantasy/league-sync)\n* [Fantasy Football Rankings](https://www.pff.com/fantasy/rankings)\n\n  Dominate your fantasy football strategy with PFF's Rankings, providing expert insights and analysis for every position and league format to power your draft and weekly lineup optimizations\n\n  Available with\n* [Premium Stats 2.0](https://premium.pff.com/nfl/teams)\n\n  Our exclusive database, featuring the most in-depth collection of NFL player performance data.\n\n  Available with\n\nSubscriptions\n\nUnlock the 2024 Fantasy Draft Kit, with Live Draft Assistant, Fantasy Mock Draft Sim, Rankings & PFF Grades\n\n$24.99/mo\n\nOR\n\n$119.99/yr\n\nAbout Us\n\n* [Jobs](/jobs)\n* [Newsroom](https://b2b.pff.com/news)\n* [PFF for Business](https://b2b.pff.com/)\n\nNews & Analysis\n\n* [NFL](/nfl)\n* [Betting](/betting)\n* [Fantasy](/fantasy)\n* [DFS](/dfs)\n* [College](/college)\n* [NFL Draft](/draft)\n\n* [NFL Score And Schedules](/nfl/scores)\n* [Player Grades](/nfl/grades/position/qb)\n* [Premium Stats](https://premium.pff.com/nfl/teams)\n* [Power Rankings](/nfl-power-rankings)\n* [Matchups](/tools/matchups)\n* [Fantasy Draft Kit](/news/fantasy-football-draft-kit-2025)\n* [Fantasy Rankings](/fantasy/rankings)\n* [Big Board 2026](/draft/big-board)\n* [Mock Draft Simulator](/draft/nfl-mock-draft-simulator)\n\nJoin PFF\n\n* [Subscribe](https://www.pff.com/join?product=plus&referrer=footer)\n* [Special Offers](/pff-offers)\n* [PFF Merchandise](https://shop.pff.com)\n\nCustomer Service\n\n* [Contact Support](https://profootballfocussupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://profootballfocussupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)\n\nFollow Us\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pff)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/profootballfocus/)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/profootballfocus)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ProFootballFocus/)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/pff)\n* [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n* [RSS](/pff-rss)\n\n[Site Map](/sitemap) [Privacy Policy](/privacy) [Terms of Use](/terms)\n\n© 2025 PFF - all rights reserved.\n\n ", 'images': []}]

2022 World Cup\n\n18 December 2022\n\nShare this quote\n\nShare\n\n##### Players recognised with individual awards at 2022 World Cup\n\n18 December 2022\n\n{0} min. reading time\n\n* **Argentina won third World Cup after penalty shoot-out victory against France**\n* **Young Player, Golden Glove, Golden Boot, and Golden Ball awards presented after final**\n* **FIFPRO recaps the winners of the Qatar 2022 player awards**\n\nAfter Argentina claimed their third men’s World Cup crown following a penalty shoot-out victory against France, four players were recognised for their outstanding performances with individual awards.\n\nThe Young Player, Golden Glove, Golden Boot, and Golden Ball awards were all presented before *La Albiceleste* lifted the men’s World Cup trophy –\xa0which closed the curtain on four thrilling weeks of international football. FIFPRO recaps the winners of the player awards at Qatar 2022.\n\n### **Young Player Award: Enzo Fernandez**\n\n**Age**: 21**Position**: Midfielder**Club**: Benfica **Nation**: Argentina\n\nEnzo Fernandez was crowned the best young player at Qatar 2022. The 21-year-old, who only made his senior debut for Argentina in September 2022, played in all of his country’s seven games at the tournament.\n\nThe midfielder saw off stern competition from the likes of team-mate Julian Alvarez, England’s Jude Bellingham, Portugal’s Goncalo Ramos, and France’s Aurelien Tchouameni to claim the award.\n\n#### **What they said**\n\n"I know Enzo very well, here from the national team and I also played against him in the Champions League. He deserves it, because he’s a spectacular kid and a very important player for us." – Lionel Messi on Enzo Fernandez.\n\n### **Golden Glove Award: Emiliano Martinez**\n\n**Age**: 30**Position**: Goalkeeper**Club**: Aston Villa**Nation**: Argentina\n\nAfter helping Argentina to a Copa America triumph last year, Emiliano Martinez went one further by adding a global title to his list of international trophies. The stopper kept three clean sheets at Qatar 2022, as well as coming out victorious in two shoot-outs.\n\nMartinez played every minute of Argentina’s campaign and saved Kingsley Coman\'s spot-kick in the final shoot-out.\n\n#### **What they said**\n\n"The World Cup is something I have been dreaming of. I have no words to express what I\'m feeling." – Emiliano Martinez.\n\n### **Golden Boot Award: Kylian Mbappe**\n\n**Age**: 23**Position**: Forward**Club**: Paris Saint-Germain**Nation**: France\n\nKylian Mbappe took home the Golden Boot Award after finishing top scorer with eight goals. Mbappe made history by becoming just the second man to net a World Cup final hat-trick, after England’s Geoff Hurst in 1966. With four goals across 2018 and 2022, the talisman has also established himself as the highest-scoring player in World Cup final history.\n\nMbappe is a two-time FIFA FIFPRO Men’s World 11 winner, having been named in the 2018 and 2019 teams.\n\n### **Golden Ball Award: Lionel Messi**\n\n**Age**: 35**Position**: Forward**Club**: Paris Saint-Germain**Nation**: Argentina\n\nLionel Messi made history by becoming the first man to win the World Cup Golden Ball twice. After first claiming the award for the World Cup’s best player at Brazil 2014, Messi picked up the Qatar 2022 gong after providing seven goals and three assists – and helping Argentina win the trophy for the first time in 32 years. Mbappe and Luka Modric received the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball respectively.\n\nMessi, who has been named in 15 successive FIFA FIFPRO Men’s World 11s, netted his 97th and 98th goals for Argentina in the final.\n\n#### **What they said**\n\n"Messi should have a place in the next World Cup. If he wants to continue playing, the \'10\' will always be his." – Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni.\n\n[News\n\n### Five-star Guardado, Messi and Ronaldo make men\'s World Cup history](/en/supporting-players/player-influence/player-impact/five-star-guardado-messi-and-ronaldo-make-men-s-world-cup-history)\n\n[### FIFPRO launches series for professional footballers to talk about social topics](/en/supporting-players/player-influence/shine-a-light/fifpro-launches-series-for-professional-footballers-to-talk-about-social-topics)\n\n[Statement\n\n### FIFPRO Statement: International Match Calendar](/en/supporting-players/competitions-innovation-and-growth/competition-design-and-structures/fifpro-statement-international-match-calendar-men-and-women)\n\n ', 'images': []}, {'url': 'https://www.pff.com/news/world-cup-2022-the-50-best-players-of-the-world-cup-including-kylian-mbappe-lionel-messi-achraf-hakimi', 'raw_content': "[All  - current](/news)\n\n[NFL Draft](/draft)\n\n# FIFA World Cup 2022: The 50 best players of the World Cup, including Kylian Mbappé, Lionel Messi, Achraf Hakimi and more\n\nBy PFF.com\n\nThe 2022 FIFA World Cup is in the books, and it marks the first major international tournament that PFF has fully graded.\n\nHarking back to PFF's early days, our staff sat down to dig into the grades and metrics to come up with a list of the top 50 players at the tournament. Here’s what they decided.\n\n### **1. Lionel Messi, Argentina**\n\nTo no surprise, the G.O.A.T. tops our list.\n\nThe Argentinian legend earned the highest dribbling grade (95.0) and completed the most dribbles (26) at the tournament, and his 60.5% completion rate was the highest among players who attempted at least 20 dribbles.\n\nThe PSG forward also earned a 90.4 passing grade, fifth among players in Qatar, while his 43 line-breaking passes finished ninth. His seven goals and three assists were just the cherry on top of an all-time tournament performance.\n\n### **2. Antoine Griezmann, France**\n\nGriezmann may not have had his best game in the final, but that should not overshadow his incredible tournament. He finished with a PFF crossing grade of 84.3, fourth among players with 10 cross attempts, while his 87.6 passing grade was also one of the World Cup's best marks. He left Qatar having created 22 chances, the second-most among all players.\n\n### **3. Achraf Hakimi, Morocco**\n\nThe PSG man finished with seven grades over 70.0, the most by any player. Chief among those were his 79.6 aerial-duel grade, his 80.1 50/50 grade and his 77.8 challenge grade.\n\nHakimi won 44 challenges in all, third at the World Cup, and led the tournament in dribbles defended with 13.\n\n### **4. Kylian Mbappé, France**\n\nThe Golden Boot winner comes in at No. 4 after scoring eight goals and accumulating two assists. Mbappé was held in check in both the quarterfinal and semifinal, as he generated only 0.03 expected goals (xG) against England and 0.33 xG against Morocco.\n\nThe French superstar did finish with a shooting grade of 86.5, good for seventh-best among players who took at least five shots. He was also a menace in possession, leading all players with 34 possessions in the opposition's box.\n\n### **5. Jude Bellingham, England**\n\nThe English wunderkind had an excellent tournament, only confirming rumors that he will be the hottest name heading into the winter transfer window.\n\nBellingham finished with three goals, one assist and four key passes, ultimately producing a 91.8 shooting grade, 76.7 passing grade and a 92.1 challenge grade.\n\nBellingham defended 70% of the dribbles against him, first among players who defended at least 10 dribbles. He also completed 89.8% of his passes, 10th among center midfielders.\n\n### **6. Theo Hernandez, France**\n\nAfter his brother Lucas was ruled out of the World Cup with an injury in France’s first match, Theo Hernandez stepped up big for Les Bleus. His 90.5 crossing grade led all full-backs and ranked second among all players in the World Cup. He also put up a 79.4 50/50 grade, a 78.9 challenge grade and an 80.1 defending-dribbles grade.\n\nThe AC Milan defender was also key in France’s attack, creating 11 chances (first among full-backs) and scoring the important opening goal in the semifinal against Morocco.\n\n### **7. Luka Modric, Croatia**\n\nThe 37-year-old Croatian legend was once again world-class in what was possibly his last World Cup. The Real Madrid maestro dominated the competition with a 91.9 passing grade and a tournament-leading leading 58 completed line-breaking passes.\n\nAlthough he couldn’t achieve the goal of winning it all, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner will still be remembered as the key player who helped Croatia win back-to-back World Cup medals.\n\n### **8. Casemiro, Brazil**\n\nDespite Brazil’s shockingly early exit from the World Cup, Casemiro had a spectacular tournament. The five-time UEFA Champions League winner orchestrated Brazil’s attack, producing an 88.0 PFF passing grade, a top-10 mark, to go with an 81.7 shooting grade.\n\nHe was also a defensive force in the midfield, leading the Brazilian side with nine blocks and winning 14 of the 15 50/50 duels he faced. In the end, he earned an 87.1 PFF grade for 50/50 duels, the fifth-best mark at the tournament.\n\n### **9. Josko Gvardiol, Croatia**\n\nOnly 20 years old, Gvardiol shined bright in his first World Cup, attracting top clubs around the world. He led all center-backs with an 88.4 grade for 50/50 duels and was a huge defensive presence, earning 70.0-plus PFF grades for challenges (75.1), defending dribbles (77.9) and tackles (71.8).\n\nHis versatility was also on display, as he completed 53 line-breaking passes, the third-most at the tournament, and all five of his dribble attempts to lead all center-backs.\n\n### **10. Mateo Kovacic, Croatia**\n\nIn addition to Croatia’s third-place finish, the Chelsea midfielder should be proud of his overall performance. He boasts three top-three PFF grades, having put up the tournament's second-best dribbling grade (93.5) and tournament-leading marks in challenge grade (94.3) and tackling grade (96.9).\n\nOn top of that, he created nine chances, second among his Croatian teammates, and applied a tournament-leading 329 pressures.\n\n### **11. Aurélien Tchouaméni, France**\n\nTchouaméni anchored the French midfield throughout the tournament, impressing in a number of games. He did miss a penalty in the World Cup final shootout, but that shouldn’t overshadow his performance. He excelled defensively, posting the highest 50/50 grade among all players (93.1) and the third-best grade among midfielders for aerial duels (90.1).\n\n### **12. Bruno Fernandes, Portugal**\n\nIt was a disappointing World Cup for Portugal, but Fernandes excelled. He was a constant threat, ultimately earning a 91.7 passing grade, and he led the tournament with eight defensive-line-breaking passes. The Manchester United midfielder also chipped in with two goals and three assists in his four games as one of the focal points of Portugal’s attack.\n\n### **13. Vinícius Junior, Brazil**\n\nThe Real Madrid star furthered his reputation as one of the most exciting players in football during his first World Cup. With six PFF grades above 70.0, he ranked above average in pretty much every category across the tournament. He produced two assists and seven key passes, contributing to his 77.5 passing grade. His best game came against South Korea in the Round of 16 when he scored and picked up one of his assists.\n\n### **14. Sofiane Boufal, Morocco**\n\nNow plying his trade in Ligue 1 with Angers, the former Southampton winger was a key part of Morocco’s history-making side. He earned a 91.0 dribbling grade over the tournament, second among players at his position. He produced a 91.5 dribbling grade in the Round of 16 against Spain alone, the second-highest single-game dribbling grade of the tournament.\n\n### **15. Julian Alvarez, Argentina**\n\nAnother player who feels like he’s announced himself as a star over the last month, Alvarez was crucial to Argentina’s World Cup win. Not even the first choice to lead the line when the tournament started, Alvarez had made the position his own by the end of the group stages. He was direct and exciting throughout the knockout stages, exemplified by his four goals and 85.5 shooting grade.\n\n### **16. Olivier Giroud, France**\n\nGiroud did not have a World Cup final to remember, but we mustn't forget the role the striker played in getting France to that point. He scored four goals to become France’s all-time leading goal scorer and was the World Cup's highest-graded player for aerial duels (94.8).\n\n### **17. Emiliano Martínez, Argentina**\n\nMartinez’s heroics in the final secured the Golden Glove Award and a No. 1 spot on [PFF's list of top goalkeepers](https://www.pff.com/news/world-cup-2022-the-5-best-goalkeepers-at-the-2022-world-cup). The quality of his shot-stopping shone through in our metrics, with Martinez boasting the tournament’s second-highest shot-stopping grade at 88.0. His positioning was also superb, as he received zero downgrades for positioning through seven matches.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Martinez’s highest-graded save was that 123rd-minute denial of Kolo Muani, which gave Argentina the opportunity to win the World Cup final on penalties. Talk about delivering when it matters most.\n\n### **18. Nayef Aguerd, Morocco**\n\nMorocco did not concede a goal to an opposition player until the semifinal, and much of this defensive success is down Aguerd. He earned the highest challenge grade (86.2) of all center-backs at this World Cup and was 100% successful on his 50/50s (2-of-2) and dribbles faced (4-of-4). On top of that, he also produced the highest clearance grade (90.4) of all center-backs.\n\n### **19. Frenkie de Jong, Netherlands**\n\nAn all-around midfielder, De Jong contributed in various ways at this World Cup. He led the Dutch side in passes completed (366), including the fifth-most line-breaking passes at the tournament (51). He was also a force in the air and put up the tournament's second-highest aerial-duel grade (93.5), behind only Oliver Giroud. He also chipped in with a goal and an assist before their quarterfinal exit to Argentina.\n\n### **20. Pedri, Spain**\n\nThe Barcelona midfielder earned a 92.1 passing grade for the tournament and was near the top of nearly every passing metric. He completed 395 passes, 13th among all players, including 52 line-breaking passes (4th), five defensive-line-breaking passes (3rd) and six chances created (37th). He was also combative when required, winning five of the seven 50/50 challenges he was involved in.\n\n### **21. Joshua Kimmich, Germany**\n\nKimmich’s 91.8 passing grade ranked third overall among all players, but that wasn’t the only area in which the playmaker excelled. As the main outlet for Germany, receiving more targets than any other teammate, he complemented his 91% pass completion rate with a 79.8 shooting grade and a 72.9 crossing grade, top-10 among central midfielders.\n\n### **22. Richarlison, Brazil**\n\nRicharlison led the line brilliantly for Brazil throughout the tournament to finish as the country’s top scorer with three goals in four matches. His shooting prowess earned a 92.4 grade, behind only Cameroon’s Vincent Aboubakar and South Korea’s Hee-chan Hwang among fellow strikers. While neither of that duo makes this list, Richarlison does for his work off-the-ball, as he recorded the most pressure attempts for Brazil (129) and won more 50/50 duels than he lost to grade out at 82.2 in that facet.\n\n### **23. Tyler Adams, United States**\n\nAnnounced as USMNT captain for the World Cup despite being only 23, Adams led by example to help his team reach the Round of 16 with a crucial performance against Iran. The midfielder starred in the winner-takes-all clash with an 89.0 passing grade and a team-leading challenge grade of 81.1.\n\n### **24. Alexis Mac Allister, Argentina**\n\nMac Allister sent Argentina on their way to a dominant first half in the final against France, starting the move that saw him provide the assist for Angel Di Maria to make it 2-0. Across the whole tournament, Mac Allister was solid in defensive duties for the champions, posting an 87.6 challenge grade while receiving only three positioning downgrades over his eight matches. If not for his 58.7 passing grade, the Argentine would be much higher on this list.\n\n### **25. Adrien Rabiot, France**\n\nAmong all players at the World Cup to be involved in more than 70 challenges, only Croatia’s Dejan Lovren fared better than France anchorman Adrien Rabiot, with the latter’s 7.2 challenges won per 90 minutes narrowly outdone by Lovren’s 7.4. Together with Aurélien Tchouaméni, Rabiot formed a formidable midfield partnership en route to earning a 90.8 aerial duel grade and an 86.0 grade on 50-50s.\n\n### **26. Éder Militão, Brazil**\n\nMilitão was the strongest performer in the Brazil back line in the tournament, particularly when involved in 50-50 duels, He won 80% of those he was involved in and earned an 84.3 50-50 duel grade to rank 15th best among all players to contest at least five 50-50 duels and fourth among all defenders. He was also reliable in the air, winning 61% of his aerial duels to reach a 77.1 grade on such instances.\n\n### **27. Wojciech Szczęsny, Poland**\n\nJuventus' Szczęsny is the second-ranked keeper on this list. Poland’s No. 1 faced the most shots on target, 27, and saved the most, 22, of any keeper throughout the tournament, despite playing in only four games. His strong performance between the posts earned him an 85.1 shot-stopping grade, the fourth-best mark at the position. An additional feather in his cap was the fact he was the only keeper to save a penalty from Lionel Messi.\n\n### **28. Cody Gakpo, Netherlands**\n\nGakpo scored in all three of the group games despite managing just three shots on target. Although he didn’t get on the scoresheet in the knockout rounds, he finished with an 81.3 shooting grade with a 100% success rate from his shots on target. And despite not coming away with any assists in the tournament, Gakpo did have the most passes of any Netherlands player that created chances for his teammates (11).\n\n### **29. Ousmane Dembélé, France**\n\nIt was a World Cup final to forget for Dembélé, who gave away an early penalty and was substituted out before halftime. However, the rest of his tournament wasn’t so lamentable. The winger ended with the 15th-best crossing grade for all players (79.4) and the 19th-best passing grade (83.6). He created 13 chances in total and finished with two assists, both of which rank second for France, behind only Antoine Griezmann.\xa0\xa0\n\n### **30. Virgil van Dijk, Netherlands**\n\nThe lasting memory of van Dijk in this World Cup will likely be his missed penalty at the start of the quarter-final shootout defeat to Argentina. Prior to that, however, the Liverpool defender had earned the fourth-best passing grade of all center-backs (84.6) with the third-most line-breaking passes of any player for the Netherlands. He was also strong in 50-50 duels, winning 80% of those he contested to earn a 78.3 50-50 grade.\n\n### **31. Raphaël Guerreiro, Portugal**\n\nGuerreiro was one of the standout full-backs at the tournament and one of Portugal's key creative threats. His 81.9 crossing grade ranked third at the position and 12th among all players. The Borussia Dortmund man also showcased the passing ability that has allowed him to play in central midfield in the past, registering an 81.8 passing grade, creating four chances and averaging 4.3 completed line-breaking passes per 90 minutes (10th for full-backs, minimum 100 passes).\n\n### **32. Harry Souttar, Australia**\n\nSouttar excelled at the back for Australia and was a key part of a side that ran eventual winners Argentina close in the Round of 16. He led all center-backs with an 89.0 aerial duel grade and won 71% of his aerial challenges. He also won 66% of the challenges he was involved in, leading the team (minimum five challenges), and recorded an 80.3 grade in a tournament performance befitting a Stoke City defender.\n\n### **33. Mohammed Kudus, Ghana**\n\nWhile it was ultimately a disappointing World Cup for Ghana, Kudus can be pleased with his performance, particularly in the win over South Korea when he scored twice. His 83.0 shooting grade and four shots on target both led the team in an impressive tournament that may well put yet another Ajax player on the radar of bigger clubs. Kudus also performed well in 50-50 duels, winning 60% of them for an 82.0 grade.\n\n### **34. Yassine Bounou, Morocco**\n\nThe tale of Morocco’s historic run to the semifinals can’t be told without a mention of Bounou’s fantastic performances, especially his three penalty shootout saves in the Round of 16 against Spain. He saved 58.3% of his shots faced, with two of the five goals he conceded deemed unsavable, and recorded an 85.8 shot-stopping grade, which ranked third for goalkeepers. Bounou also won all four of his aerial duels for a 73.6 grade, which ranked second among goalkeepers.\n\n### **35. Jamal Musiala, Germany**\n\nGermany underperformed at the World Cup, but Musiala at least provided a bright spot. The Bayern Munich player was the third-best dribbler at the tournament by our metrics, boasting a 91.3 grade. Despite playing in only three games, he attempted the fourth-most dribbles of any player. And he still managed to complete 56.67% of them, good for 19th overall (minimum 10 dribbles). Musiala also recorded a 73.1 aerial duel grade that ranked sixth for attacking midfielders.\n\n### **36. Diogo Dalot, Portugal**\n\nAs a full-back more renowned for his attacking talents, Dalot used the 2022 World Cup to showcase his defensive abilities. Dalot was the No. 1-ranked full-back with an 87.6 challenge grade, winning eight of his 11 aerial duels and one of his two 50-50 challenges. He tops all players in the tournament with a 92.9 grade defending against the dribble, winning 80% of the dribbles attempted against him.\xa0\n\n### **37. Luis Chávez, Mexico**\n\nChávez had a monstrous tournament in Qatar, leading El Tri in several of our key facets. Chávez finished with an 81.3 passing grade for the tournament, ranking 10th among all central midfielders. Chávez also leaves Qatar with a 78.5 crossing grade, third at the position. Perhaps most impressively, his 93.2 shooting grade led the position and he finished third overall when striking the ball this tournament.\xa0\n\n### **38. Granit Xhaka, Switzerland**\n\nXhaka continued his renaissance of good form this season in the Premier League into Qatar, where he finished fifth among all players with an 88.1 passing grade on 88% pass completion. Xhaka led all Swiss players with his 76.0 challenge grade and ranked fourth among all central midfielders with an 86.5 aerial duel grade, winning nine of his 14 duels in the air.\n\n### **39. Enner Valencia, Ecuador**\n\nThrough the opening two fixtures, Valencia was the leading goal scorer of the tournament. An unfortunate knee injury prevented him from finishing the match against the Dutch, though, and he certainly wasn’t at 100% in Ecuador's pivotal final match against Senegal. Still, Valencia managed to finish as the fourth-highest-graded shooter, with a 93.1 shooting grade. Valencia also led all Ecuadorians with 11 possessions in the opponent's penalty area.\n\n### **40. Dominik Livaković, Croatia**\n\nLivaković was a rock for the third-place Croatian side in this tournament, facing more shots (78) than any other goalkeeper in the competition. Livaković had numerous highlights throughout the tournament, securing a clean sheet against both Morocco and Belgium in the group stage. He came up huge in both penalty shootouts Croatia participated in, with an incredible three saves in the shootout against Japan in the Round of 16, followed by another penalty save in their upset against tournament favorites Brazil in the quarterfinals.\n\n### **41. Enzo Fernández, Argentina**\n\nHaving earned the Best Young Player award at the World Cup, Fernández was a live wire in the heart of the Argentinian midfield, completing 87.9% of the passes he attempted. His 77.8 challenge grade for the tournament showed the other side of his game, too. The cherry on the cake of his performances was a wonder goal against Mexico.\n\n### **42. Azzedine Ounahi, Morocco**\n\nAnother young gem of this edition of the World cup, Ounahi was an integral part of Morocco's dream run to the semi-finals. He produced an 87.7 PFF dribbling grade, ranking second among central midfielders. He impressed as a passer, too, with his 35 line-breaking passes ranking 13th at the position.\n\n### **43. Dani Olmo, Spain**\n\nOlmo led all players with a 94.2 PFF crossing grade from 14 crosses at the tournament. He scored Spain’s opening goal of the tournament and finished with a 79.1 PFF shooting grade. Olmo completed 84.8% of his passes at the tournament, including six line-breaking passes.\n\n### **44. Silvan Widmer, Switzerland**\n\nWidmer impressed going forward and creating for Switzerland at the tournament, producing an 82.9 PFF crossing grade that ranked second among all full-backs, behind only France’s Theo Hernández. He defended well, too, as shown by his 84.8 PFF 50-50 duel grade and 85.5 PFF defending dribbles grade.\n\n### **45. Harry Maguire, England**\n\nConstantly under the microscope for his performances at the club level, Maguire was included in England’s World Cup team and rightly proved the critics wrong. Always an aerial threat offensively, Maguire was a sentinel in defense for England. An 86.1 tackling grade (third) and 83.5 challenge grade (seventh) make a case for him as one of the center-backs of the tournament. He was unlucky on a couple of occasions when his powerful headers hit the crossbar and deprived him of goals to add to his outstanding defensive feats.\n\n### **46. Ismail Jakobs, Senegal**\n\nJakobs' 93.3 PFF aerial duel grade was the third best of any player at the tournament, while his 81.7 PFF tackling grade ranked 29th. He won 81.8% of the 22 aerial duels he was involved in and successfully completed a tackle on four of eight attempts. He also successfully defended three of the five dribbles he faced and won four of the six 50-50 duels he was involved in.\n\n### **47. Jordan Pickford, England**\n\nPickford stood out between the sticks for England with consistently impressive performances. His 93.3 shot-stopping grade was the best of any goalkeeper at the tournament, while his 75.6 passing grade ranked second at the position to only Switzerland’s Yann Sommer.\n\n### **48. Kim Young-gwon, South Korea**\n\nKim was tremendously consistent for South Korea at the tournament, putting forth a strong performance in a number of facets. He finished with 70.0-plus PFF grades in passing (77.7), aerial duels (82.0), challenges (71.5) and clearances (76.0).\n\n### **49. Ritsu Doan, Japan**\n\nDoan was one of the top crossers of the ball at the tournament, with his 83.9 PFF crossing grade the third best among all players who attempted at least 10 crosses at the tournament. He also impressed on 50-50 duels, winning four of the seven he attempted to earn an 83.2 50-50 duel grade — 19th best among all players to contest at least five 50-50 duels throughout the competition.\xa0\n\n### **50. Neymar, Brazil**\n\nDespite playing in just three games at the tournament after missing Brazil's second and third group stage contests through injury, Neymar was still a key player at the tournament, ranking tied for 28th with 28 line-breaking passes received throughout the World Cup. He was tied for the sixth-most dribbles attempted (27) and tied for the seventh-most dribbles completed (14) at the tournament despite the limited playing time.\n\nAll Featured Tools\n\n* [PFF Player Prop Tool (New!)](https://www.pff.com/betting/player-props)\n* [Key Insights](https://www.pff.com/betting/key-insights)\n\n  AI-powered football analysis for winning decisions\n\n  Available with\n* [NFL Matchups](https://www.pff.com/tools/matchups)\n* [Player Grades](https://www.pff.com/nfl/grades/position/qb)\n* [Fantasy League Sync](https://www.pff.com/fantasy/league-sync)\n* [Fantasy Football Rankings](https://www.pff.com/fantasy/rankings)\n\n  Dominate your fantasy football strategy with PFF's Rankings, providing expert insights and analysis for every position and league format to power your draft and weekly lineup optimizations\n\n  Available with\n* [Premium Stats 2.0](https://premium.pff.com/nfl/teams)\n\n  Our exclusive database, featuring the most in-depth collection of NFL player performance data.\n\n  Available with\n\nSubscriptions\n\nUnlock the 2024 Fantasy Draft Kit, with Live Draft Assistant, Fantasy Mock Draft Sim, Rankings & PFF Grades\n\n$24.99/mo\n\nOR\n\n$119.99/yr\n\nAbout Us\n\n* [Jobs](/jobs)\n* [Newsroom](https://b2b.pff.com/news)\n* [PFF for Business](https://b2b.pff.com/)\n\nNews & Analysis\n\n* [NFL](/nfl)\n* [Betting](/betting)\n* [Fantasy](/fantasy)\n* [DFS](/dfs)\n* [College](/college)\n* [NFL Draft](/draft)\n\n* [NFL Score And Schedules](/nfl/scores)\n* [Player Grades](/nfl/grades/position/qb)\n* [Premium Stats](https://premium.pff.com/nfl/teams)\n* [Power Rankings](/nfl-power-rankings)\n* [Matchups](/tools/matchups)\n* [Fantasy Draft Kit](/news/fantasy-football-draft-kit-2025)\n* [Fantasy Rankings](/fantasy/rankings)\n* [Big Board 2026](/draft/big-board)\n* [Mock Draft Simulator](/draft/nfl-mock-draft-simulator)\n\nJoin PFF\n\n* [Subscribe](https://www.pff.com/join?product=plus&referrer=footer)\n* [Special Offers](/pff-offers)\n* [PFF Merchandise](https://shop.pff.com)\n\nCustomer Service\n\n* [Contact Support](https://profootballfocussupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)\n* [Frequently Asked Questions](https://profootballfocussupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)\n\nFollow Us\n\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pff)\n* [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/profootballfocus/)\n* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/profootballfocus)\n* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ProFootballFocus/)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/pff)\n* [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n* [RSS](/pff-rss)\n\n[Site Map](/sitemap) [Privacy Policy](/privacy) [Terms of Use](/terms)\n\n© 2025 PFF - all rights reserved.\n\n ", 'images': []}]

[**Lionel Messi**](https://olympics.com/en/athletes/lionel-messi), **Kylian Mbappe** and **Emiliano Martinez** collected the big individual prizes at [**FIFA World Cup 2022**](https://olympics.com/en/sport-events/2022-fifa-football-world-cup-qatar/) in Qatar.

Just a matter of minutes before lifting the World Cup trophy for the first time, following [Argentina's epic penalty shoot-out win over France](https://olympics.com/en/news/lionel-messi-world-cup-final-trophy-argentina-france-2022-penalties), Messi received the Golden Ball awarded to the tournament's best player.

On the stage, he gave the World Cup trophy a kiss as he held his personal gong.

Messi had won the Golden Ball in 2014 in Brazil where Argentina **suffered heartbreak in the final**, going down 1-0 in extra time to Germany.

But this time, the 35-year-old got his hands on the one trophy that had thus far eluded him throughout his spectacular career.

Mbappe took the Silver Ball for second place with 2018 Golden Ball winner **Luka Modric** receiving the Bronze Ball for third.

## Kylian Mbappe pips Lionel Messi to Golden Boot

Mbappe took the Golden Boot after his hat-trick in the final put him on eight goals, one clear of PSG club colleague Messi who scored twice on the day.

That took Mbappe to 12 goals in just two tournaments with **Miroslav Klose's** record of 16 World Cup goals definitely in his sights.

The 23-year-old has scored 36 goals in 66 France appearances and continues to bolster his reputation as one of the finest forwards on the planet.

## Emi Martinez takes Golden Glove after more penalty heroics

Argentina goalkeeper Martinez scooped the Golden Glove for best goalkeeper after saving a penalty from **Kingsley Coman** in the shoot-out.

He also made a wonderful save late in extra time to deny **Randal Kolo Muani** a goal which would have put France ahead for the first time.

The Aston Villa shotstopper had been the hero of Argentina's quarter-final victory over the Netherlands, making two saves in the penalty shoot-out.

## Enzo Fernandez claims Young Player award

There was another Argentinian winner in Qatar as **Enzo Fernandez** claimed the Young Player of the Tournament award.

The Benfica midfielder was a substitute in his country's first two matches, but his **spectacular strike against Mexico** helped cement him a starting berth.

Fernandez, who turns 22 next month, formed a strong midfield trio alongside **Rodrigo De Paul** and **Alexis Mac Allister** which allowed Messi to weave his magic.

His performances have attracted the attentions of the biggest clubs in Europe with Real Madrid and Liverpool reportedly interested in acquiring his services.

Beaten quarter-finalists **England** received the Fair Play Award after picking up just one booking in five matches.

* **Argentina won third World Cup after penalty shoot-out victory against France**
* **Young Player, Golden Glove, Golden Boot, and Golden Ball awards presented after final**
* **FIFPRO recaps the winners of the Qatar 2022 player awards**

After Argentina claimed their third men’s World Cup crown following a penalty shoot-out victory against France, four players were recognised for their outstanding performances with individual awards.

The Young Player, Golden Glove, Golden Boot, and Golden Ball awards were all presented before *La Albiceleste* lifted the men’s World Cup trophy – which closed the curtain on four thrilling weeks of international football. FIFPRO recaps the winners of the player awards at Qatar 2022.

### **Young Player Award: Enzo Fernandez**

**Age**: 21**Position**: Midfielder**Club**: Benfica **Nation**: Argentina

Enzo Fernandez was crowned the best young player at Qatar 2022. The 21-year-old, who only made his senior debut for Argentina in September 2022, played in all of his country’s seven games at the tournament.

The midfielder saw off stern competition from the likes of team-mate Julian Alvarez, England’s Jude Bellingham, Portugal’s Goncalo Ramos, and France’s Aurelien Tchouameni to claim the award.

#### **What they said**

"I know Enzo very well, here from the national team and I also played against him in the Champions League. He deserves it, because he’s a spectacular kid and a very important player for us." – Lionel Messi on Enzo Fernandez.

### **Golden Glove Award: Emiliano Martinez**

**Age**: 30**Position**: Goalkeeper**Club**: Aston Villa**Nation**: Argentina

After helping Argentina to a Copa America triumph last year, Emiliano Martinez went one further by adding a global title to his list of international trophies. The stopper kept three clean sheets at Qatar 2022, as well as coming out victorious in two shoot-outs.

Martinez played every minute of Argentina’s campaign and saved Kingsley Coman's spot-kick in the final shoot-out.

#### **What they said**

"The World Cup is something I have been dreaming of. I have no words to express what I'm feeling." – Emiliano Martinez.

### **Golden Boot Award: Kylian Mbappe**

**Age**: 23**Position**: Forward**Club**: Paris Saint-Germain**Nation**: France

Kylian Mbappe took home the Golden Boot Award after finishing top scorer with eight goals. Mbappe made history by becoming just the second man to net a World Cup final hat-trick, after England’s Geoff Hurst in 1966. With four goals across 2018 and 2022, the talisman has also established himself as the highest-scoring player in World Cup final history.

Mbappe is a two-time FIFA FIFPRO Men’s World 11 winner, having been named in the 2018 and 2019 teams.

### **Golden Ball Award: Lionel Messi**

**Age**: 35**Position**: Forward**Club**: Paris Saint-Germain**Nation**: Argentina

Lionel Messi made history by becoming the first man to win the World Cup Golden Ball twice. After first claiming the award for the World Cup’s best player at Brazil 2014, Messi picked up the Qatar 2022 gong after providing seven goals and three assists – and helping Argentina win the trophy for the first time in 32 years. Mbappe and Luka Modric received the Silver Ball and Bronze Ball respectively.

Messi, who has been named in 15 successive FIFA FIFPRO Men’s World 11s, netted his 97th and 98th goals for Argentina in the final.

#### **What they said**

"Messi should have a place in the next World Cup. If he wants to continue playing, the '10' will always be his." – Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni.

# FIFA World Cup 2022: The 50 best players of the World Cup, including Kylian Mbappé, Lionel Messi, Achraf Hakimi and more

By PFF.com

The 2022 FIFA World Cup is in the books, and it marks the first major international tournament that PFF has fully graded.

Harking back to PFF's early days, our staff sat down to dig into the grades and metrics to come up with a list of the top 50 players at the tournament. Here’s what they decided.

### **1. Lionel Messi, Argentina**

To no surprise, the G.O.A.T. tops our list.

The Argentinian legend earned the highest dribbling grade (95.0) and completed the most dribbles (26) at the tournament, and his 60.5% completion rate was the highest among players who attempted at least 20 dribbles.

The PSG forward also earned a 90.4 passing grade, fifth among players in Qatar, while his 43 line-breaking passes finished ninth. His seven goals and three assists were just the cherry on top of an all-time tournament performance.

### **2. Antoine Griezmann, France**

Griezmann may not have had his best game in the final, but that should not overshadow his incredible tournament. He finished with a PFF crossing grade of 84.3, fourth among players with 10 cross attempts, while his 87.6 passing grade was also one of the World Cup's best marks. He left Qatar having created 22 chances, the second-most among all players.

### **3. Achraf Hakimi, Morocco**

The PSG man finished with seven grades over 70.0, the most by any player. Chief among those were his 79.6 aerial-duel grade, his 80.1 50/50 grade and his 77.8 challenge grade.

Hakimi won 44 challenges in all, third at the World Cup, and led the tournament in dribbles defended with 13.

### **4. Kylian Mbappé, France**

The Golden Boot winner comes in at No. 4 after scoring eight goals and accumulating two assists. Mbappé was held in check in both the quarterfinal and semifinal, as he generated only 0.03 expected goals (xG) against England and 0.33 xG against Morocco.

The French superstar did finish with a shooting grade of 86.5, good for seventh-best among players who took at least five shots. He was also a menace in possession, leading all players with 34 possessions in the opposition's box.

### **5. Jude Bellingham, England**

The English wunderkind had an excellent tournament, only confirming rumors that he will be the hottest name heading into the winter transfer window.

Bellingham finished with three goals, one assist and four key passes, ultimately producing a 91.8 shooting grade, 76.7 passing grade and a 92.1 challenge grade.

Bellingham defended 70% of the dribbles against him, first among players who defended at least 10 dribbles. He also completed 89.8% of his passes, 10th among center midfielders.

### **6. Theo Hernandez, France**

After his brother Lucas was ruled out of the World Cup with an injury in France’s first match, Theo Hernandez stepped up big for Les Bleus. His 90.5 crossing grade led all full-backs and ranked second among all players in the World Cup. He also put up a 79.4 50/50 grade, a 78.9 challenge grade and an 80.1 defending-dribbles grade.

The AC Milan defender was also key in France’s attack, creating 11 chances (first among full-backs) and scoring the important opening goal in the semifinal against Morocco.

### **7. Luka Modric, Croatia**

The 37-year-old Croatian legend was once again world-class in what was possibly his last World Cup. The Real Madrid maestro dominated the competition with a 91.9 passing grade and a tournament-leading leading 58 completed line-breaking passes.

Although he couldn’t achieve the goal of winning it all, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner will still be remembered as the key player who helped Croatia win back-to-back World Cup medals.

### **8. Casemiro, Brazil**

Despite Brazil’s shockingly early exit from the World Cup, Casemiro had a spectacular tournament. The five-time UEFA Champions League winner orchestrated Brazil’s attack, producing an 88.0 PFF passing grade, a top-10 mark, to go with an 81.7 shooting grade.

He was also a defensive force in the midfield, leading the Brazilian side with nine blocks and winning 14 of the 15 50/50 duels he faced. In the end, he earned an 87.1 PFF grade for 50/50 duels, the fifth-best mark at the tournament.

### **9. Josko Gvardiol, Croatia**

Only 20 years old, Gvardiol shined bright in his first World Cup, attracting top clubs around the world. He led all center-backs with an 88.4 grade for 50/50 duels and was a huge defensive presence, earning 70.0-plus PFF grades for challenges (75.1), defending dribbles (77.9) and tackles (71.8).

His versatility was also on display, as he completed 53 line-breaking passes, the third-most at the tournament, and all five of his dribble attempts to lead all center-backs.

### **10. Mateo Kovacic, Croatia**

In addition to Croatia’s third-place finish, the Chelsea midfielder should be proud of his overall performance. He boasts three top-three PFF grades, having put up the tournament's second-best dribbling grade (93.5) and tournament-leading marks in challenge grade (94.3) and tackling grade (96.9).

On top of that, he created nine chances, second among his Croatian teammates, and applied a tournament-leading 329 pressures.

### **11. Aurélien Tchouaméni, France**

Tchouaméni anchored the French midfield throughout the tournament, impressing in a number of games. He did miss a penalty in the World Cup final shootout, but that shouldn’t overshadow his performance. He excelled defensively, posting the highest 50/50 grade among all players (93.1) and the third-best grade among midfielders for aerial duels (90.1).

### **12. Bruno Fernandes, Portugal**

It was a disappointing World Cup for Portugal, but Fernandes excelled. He was a constant threat, ultimately earning a 91.7 passing grade, and he led the tournament with eight defensive-line-breaking passes. The Manchester United midfielder also chipped in with two goals and three assists in his four games as one of the focal points of Portugal’s attack.

### **13. Vinícius Junior, Brazil**

The Real Madrid star furthered his reputation as one of the most exciting players in football during his first World Cup. With six PFF grades above 70.0, he ranked above average in pretty much every category across the tournament. He produced two assists and seven key passes, contributing to his 77.5 passing grade. His best game came against South Korea in the Round of 16 when he scored and picked up one of his assists.

### **14. Sofiane Boufal, Morocco**

Now plying his trade in Ligue 1 with Angers, the former Southampton winger was a key part of Morocco’s history-making side. He earned a 91.0 dribbling grade over the tournament, second among players at his position. He produced a 91.5 dribbling grade in the Round of 16 against Spain alone, the second-highest single-game dribbling grade of the tournament.

### **15. Julian Alvarez, Argentina**

Another player who feels like he’s announced himself as a star over the last month, Alvarez was crucial to Argentina’s World Cup win. Not even the first choice to lead the line when the tournament started, Alvarez had made the position his own by the end of the group stages. He was direct and exciting throughout the knockout stages, exemplified by his four goals and 85.5 shooting grade.

### **16. Olivier Giroud, France**

Giroud did not have a World Cup final to remember, but we mustn't forget the role the striker played in getting France to that point. He scored four goals to become France’s all-time leading goal scorer and was the World Cup's highest-graded player for aerial duels (94.8).

### **17. Emiliano Martínez, Argentina**

Martinez’s heroics in the final secured the Golden Glove Award and a No. 1 spot on [PFF's list of top goalkeepers](https://www.pff.com/news/world-cup-2022-the-5-best-goalkeepers-at-the-2022-world-cup). The quality of his shot-stopping shone through in our metrics, with Martinez boasting the tournament’s second-highest shot-stopping grade at 88.0. His positioning was also superb, as he received zero downgrades for positioning through seven matches.

Unsurprisingly, Martinez’s highest-graded save was that 123rd-minute denial of Kolo Muani, which gave Argentina the opportunity to win the World Cup final on penalties. Talk about delivering when it matters most.

### **18. Nayef Aguerd, Morocco**

Morocco did not concede a goal to an opposition player until the semifinal, and much of this defensive success is down Aguerd. He earned the highest challenge grade (86.2) of all center-backs at this World Cup and was 100% successful on his 50/50s (2-of-2) and dribbles faced (4-of-4). On top of that, he also produced the highest clearance grade (90.4) of all center-backs.

### **19. Frenkie de Jong, Netherlands**

An all-around midfielder, De Jong contributed in various ways at this World Cup. He led the Dutch side in passes completed (366), including the fifth-most line-breaking passes at the tournament (51). He was also a force in the air and put up the tournament's second-highest aerial-duel grade (93.5), behind only Oliver Giroud. He also chipped in with a goal and an assist before their quarterfinal exit to Argentina.

### **20. Pedri, Spain**

The Barcelona midfielder earned a 92.1 passing grade for the tournament and was near the top of nearly every passing metric. He completed 395 passes, 13th among all players, including 52 line-breaking passes (4th), five defensive-line-breaking passes (3rd) and six chances created (37th). He was also combative when required, winning five of the seven 50/50 challenges he was involved in.

### **21. Joshua Kimmich, Germany**

Kimmich’s 91.8 passing grade ranked third overall among all players, but that wasn’t the only area in which the playmaker excelled. As the main outlet for Germany, receiving more targets than any other teammate, he complemented his 91% pass completion rate with a 79.8 shooting grade and a 72.9 crossing grade, top-10 among central midfielders.

### **22. Richarlison, Brazil**

Richarlison led the line brilliantly for Brazil throughout the tournament to finish as the country’s top scorer with three goals in four matches. His shooting prowess earned a 92.4 grade, behind only Cameroon’s Vincent Aboubakar and South Korea’s Hee-chan Hwang among fellow strikers. While neither of that duo makes this list, Richarlison does for his work off-the-ball, as he recorded the most pressure attempts for Brazil (129) and won more 50/50 duels than he lost to grade out at 82.2 in that facet.

### **23. Tyler Adams, United States**

Announced as USMNT captain for the World Cup despite being only 23, Adams led by example to help his team reach the Round of 16 with a crucial performance against Iran. The midfielder starred in the winner-takes-all clash with an 89.0 passing grade and a team-leading challenge grade of 81.1.

### **24. Alexis Mac Allister, Argentina**

Mac Allister sent Argentina on their way to a dominant first half in the final against France, starting the move that saw him provide the assist for Angel Di Maria to make it 2-0. Across the whole tournament, Mac Allister was solid in defensive duties for the champions, posting an 87.6 challenge grade while receiving only three positioning downgrades over his eight matches. If not for his 58.7 passing grade, the Argentine would be much higher on this list.

### **25. Adrien Rabiot, France**

Among all players at the World Cup to be involved in more than 70 challenges, only Croatia’s Dejan Lovren fared better than France anchorman Adrien Rabiot, with the latter’s 7.2 challenges won per 90 minutes narrowly outdone by Lovren’s 7.4. Together with Aurélien Tchouaméni, Rabiot formed a formidable midfield partnership en route to earning a 90.8 aerial duel grade and an 86.0 grade on 50-50s.

### **26. Éder Militão, Brazil**

Militão was the strongest performer in the Brazil back line in the tournament, particularly when involved in 50-50 duels, He won 80% of those he was involved in and earned an 84.3 50-50 duel grade to rank 15th best among all players to contest at least five 50-50 duels and fourth among all defenders. He was also reliable in the air, winning 61% of his aerial duels to reach a 77.1 grade on such instances.

### **27. Wojciech Szczęsny, Poland**

Juventus' Szczęsny is the second-ranked keeper on this list. Poland’s No. 1 faced the most shots on target, 27, and saved the most, 22, of any keeper throughout the tournament, despite playing in only four games. His strong performance between the posts earned him an 85.1 shot-stopping grade, the fourth-best mark at the position. An additional feather in his cap was the fact he was the only keeper to save a penalty from Lionel Messi.

### **28. Cody Gakpo, Netherlands**

Gakpo scored in all three of the group games despite managing just three shots on target. Although he didn’t get on the scoresheet in the knockout rounds, he finished with an 81.3 shooting grade with a 100% success rate from his shots on target. And despite not coming away with any assists in the tournament, Gakpo did have the most passes of any Netherlands player that created chances for his teammates (11).

### **29. Ousmane Dembélé, France**

It was a World Cup final to forget for Dembélé, who gave away an early penalty and was substituted out before halftime. However, the rest of his tournament wasn’t so lamentable. The winger ended with the 15th-best crossing grade for all players (79.4) and the 19th-best passing grade (83.6). He created 13 chances in total and finished with two assists, both of which rank second for France, behind only Antoine Griezmann.  

### **30. Virgil van Dijk, Netherlands**

The lasting memory of van Dijk in this World Cup will likely be his missed penalty at the start of the quarter-final shootout defeat to Argentina. Prior to that, however, the Liverpool defender had earned the fourth-best passing grade of all center-backs (84.6) with the third-most line-breaking passes of any player for the Netherlands. He was also strong in 50-50 duels, winning 80% of those he contested to earn a 78.3 50-50 grade.

### **31. Raphaël Guerreiro, Portugal**

Guerreiro was one of the standout full-backs at the tournament and one of Portugal's key creative threats. His 81.9 crossing grade ranked third at the position and 12th among all players. The Borussia Dortmund man also showcased the passing ability that has allowed him to play in central midfield in the past, registering an 81.8 passing grade, creating four chances and averaging 4.3 completed line-breaking passes per 90 minutes (10th for full-backs, minimum 100 passes).

### **32. Harry Souttar, Australia**

Souttar excelled at the back for Australia and was a key part of a side that ran eventual winners Argentina close in the Round of 16. He led all center-backs with an 89.0 aerial duel grade and won 71% of his aerial challenges. He also won 66% of the challenges he was involved in, leading the team (minimum five challenges), and recorded an 80.3 grade in a tournament performance befitting a Stoke City defender.

### **33. Mohammed Kudus, Ghana**

While it was ultimately a disappointing World Cup for Ghana, Kudus can be pleased with his performance, particularly in the win over South Korea when he scored twice. His 83.0 shooting grade and four shots on target both led the team in an impressive tournament that may well put yet another Ajax player on the radar of bigger clubs. Kudus also performed well in 50-50 duels, winning 60% of them for an 82.0 grade.

### **34. Yassine Bounou, Morocco**

The tale of Morocco’s historic run to the semifinals can’t be told without a mention of Bounou’s fantastic performances, especially his three penalty shootout saves in the Round of 16 against Spain. He saved 58.3% of his shots faced, with two of the five goals he conceded deemed unsavable, and recorded an 85.8 shot-stopping grade, which ranked third for goalkeepers. Bounou also won all four of his aerial duels for a 73.6 grade, which ranked second among goalkeepers.

### **35. Jamal Musiala, Germany**

Germany underperformed at the World Cup, but Musiala at least provided a bright spot. The Bayern Munich player was the third-best dribbler at the tournament by our metrics, boasting a 91.3 grade. Despite playing in only three games, he attempted the fourth-most dribbles of any player. And he still managed to complete 56.67% of them, good for 19th overall (minimum 10 dribbles). Musiala also recorded a 73.1 aerial duel grade that ranked sixth for attacking midfielders.

### **36. Diogo Dalot, Portugal**

As a full-back more renowned for his attacking talents, Dalot used the 2022 World Cup to showcase his defensive abilities. Dalot was the No. 1-ranked full-back with an 87.6 challenge grade, winning eight of his 11 aerial duels and one of his two 50-50 challenges. He tops all players in the tournament with a 92.9 grade defending against the dribble, winning 80% of the dribbles attempted against him. 

### **37. Luis Chávez, Mexico**

Chávez had a monstrous tournament in Qatar, leading El Tri in several of our key facets. Chávez finished with an 81.3 passing grade for the tournament, ranking 10th among all central midfielders. Chávez also leaves Qatar with a 78.5 crossing grade, third at the position. Perhaps most impressively, his 93.2 shooting grade led the position and he finished third overall when striking the ball this tournament. 

### **38. Granit Xhaka, Switzerland**

Xhaka continued his renaissance of good form this season in the Premier League into Qatar, where he finished fifth among all players with an 88.1 passing grade on 88% pass completion. Xhaka led all Swiss players with his 76.0 challenge grade and ranked fourth among all central midfielders with an 86.5 aerial duel grade, winning nine of his 14 duels in the air.

### **39. Enner Valencia, Ecuador**

Through the opening two fixtures, Valencia was the leading goal scorer of the tournament. An unfortunate knee injury prevented him from finishing the match against the Dutch, though, and he certainly wasn’t at 100% in Ecuador's pivotal final match against Senegal. Still, Valencia managed to finish as the fourth-highest-graded shooter, with a 93.1 shooting grade. Valencia also led all Ecuadorians with 11 possessions in the opponent's penalty area.

### **40. Dominik Livaković, Croatia**

Livaković was a rock for the third-place Croatian side in this tournament, facing more shots (78) than any other goalkeeper in the competition. Livaković had numerous highlights throughout the tournament, securing a clean sheet against both Morocco and Belgium in the group stage. He came up huge in both penalty shootouts Croatia participated in, with an incredible three saves in the shootout against Japan in the Round of 16, followed by another penalty save in their upset against tournament favorites Brazil in the quarterfinals.

### **41. Enzo Fernández, Argentina**

Having earned the Best Young Player award at the World Cup, Fernández was a live wire in the heart of the Argentinian midfield, completing 87.9% of the passes he attempted. His 77.8 challenge grade for the tournament showed the other side of his game, too. The cherry on the cake of his performances was a wonder goal against Mexico.

### **42. Azzedine Ounahi, Morocco**

Another young gem of this edition of the World cup, Ounahi was an integral part of Morocco's dream run to the semi-finals. He produced an 87.7 PFF dribbling grade, ranking second among central midfielders. He impressed as a passer, too, with his 35 line-breaking passes ranking 13th at the position.

### **43. Dani Olmo, Spain**

Olmo led all players with a 94.2 PFF crossing grade from 14 crosses at the tournament. He scored Spain’s opening goal of the tournament and finished with a 79.1 PFF shooting grade. Olmo completed 84.8% of his passes at the tournament, including six line-breaking passes.

### **44. Silvan Widmer, Switzerland**

Widmer impressed going forward and creating for Switzerland at the tournament, producing an 82.9 PFF crossing grade that ranked second among all full-backs, behind only France’s Theo Hernández. He defended well, too, as shown by his 84.8 PFF 50-50 duel grade and 85.5 PFF defending dribbles grade.

### **45. Harry Maguire, England**

Constantly under the microscope for his performances at the club level, Maguire was included in England’s World Cup team and rightly proved the critics wrong. Always an aerial threat offensively, Maguire was a sentinel in defense for England. An 86.1 tackling grade (third) and 83.5 challenge grade (seventh) make a case for him as one of the center-backs of the tournament. He was unlucky on a couple of occasions when his powerful headers hit the crossbar and deprived him of goals to add to his outstanding defensive feats.

### **46. Ismail Jakobs, Senegal**

Jakobs' 93.3 PFF aerial duel grade was the third best of any player at the tournament, while his 81.7 PFF tackling grade ranked 29th. He won 81.8% of the 22 aerial duels he was involved in and successfully completed a tackle on four of eight attempts. He also successfully defended three of the five dribbles he faced and won four of the six 50-50 duels he was involved in.

### **47. Jordan Pickford, England**

Pickford stood out between the sticks for England with consistently impressive performances. His 93.3 shot-stopping grade was the best of any goalkeeper at the tournament, while his 75.6 passing grade ranked second at the position to only Switzerland’s Yann Sommer.

### **48. Kim Young-gwon, South Korea**

Kim was tremendously consistent for South Korea at the tournament, putting forth a strong performance in a number of facets. He finished with 70.0-plus PFF grades in passing (77.7), aerial duels (82.0), challenges (71.5) and clearances (76.0).

### **49. Ritsu Doan, Japan**

Doan was one of the top crossers of the ball at the tournament, with his 83.9 PFF crossing grade the third best among all players who attempted at least 10 crosses at the tournament. He also impressed on 50-50 duels, winning four of the seven he attempted to earn an 83.2 50-50 duel grade — 19th best among all players to contest at least five 50-50 duels throughout the competition. 

### **50. Neymar, Brazil**

Despite playing in just three games at the tournament after missing Brazil's second and third group stage contests through injury, Neymar was still a key player at the tournament, ranking tied for 28th with 28 line-breaking passes received throughout the World Cup. He was tied for the sixth-most dribbles attempted (27) and tied for the seventh-most dribbles completed (14) at the tournament despite the limited playing time.
